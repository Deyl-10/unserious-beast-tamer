Chapter 381: Chapter 233: The Nightmare Beast King that Rushes to the Beast Emperor_2

Name…

There was an inexplicable glow in the Velvet Sparrow’s eyes.

“Chirp!” (My name is Twelve!)

“…Huh?” Xu Ran blinked, revealing a surprised expression.

He was not surprised that the Velvet Sparrow already had a name, but rather that its name was so extraordinary.

“Alright, if that’s the case, I’ll call you Twelve.” Xu Ran smiled and rubbed the Velvet Sparrow’s head, then looked at Ziyun, Star, and Cancan.

Speaking of which, the names of his four pet beasts all seemed to have different styles.

Well, it’s not a big deal.

“Chirp!” (Great!)

Twelve slightly tiptoed, voluntarily rubbing Xu Ran’s palm. Its sea-blue eyes slightly squinted, its face showing a somewhat contented expression.

As the twelfth daughter of the Nightmare Beast King, the other members of its race and other Transcendent Beings in the Beast Field call it the Twelfth Princess. Only its parents and siblings call it “Twelve”.

This is a way of address unique to family. It loved being called by Xu Ran in this way.

“You lot should go to sleep, I need to meditate as much as I can.” Xu Ran said with a smile, letting go of his hand and getting in a comfortable position on his bed.

Emboldened by his decision to form a contract with Twelve, his motivation to meditate increased.

The next moment, Xu Ran drifted into deep meditation.

As she watched Xu Ran with his eyes closed in deep meditation, curiosity flickered in Twelve’s eyes.

Was this how human Beast Masters trained? This was her first time witnessing it.

According to Xu Ran, in just over a dozen days, he could break through to the Fourth Stage of contract power, and form a contract with her.

So…

Twelve cast an encouraging look at Xu Ran.

Keep it up!

The next moment, Twelve suddenly felt that something was off.

Before she could turn back, she was in two fluffy claws.

Huh?

Huh?!

Seeing Ziyun, who had embraced her, Twelve looked slightly horrified.

“Meow-” (Sleep time!)

Ziyun stuffed Twelve into her arms, curled up, and showed a satisfied expression.

Um- She had wanted to do this for a long time.

Laying on Cancan’s scales, with her head resting on Star’s neck, Ziyun quickly closed her eyes, and slowly fell asleep.

As time passed, poor little Twelve, curled up helplessly and unable to move in Ziyun’s embrace, gradually came to her senses, her face showing a near-tearful expression.

How was she supposed to sleep like this?

While Twelve was slowly integrating into the little family of one human and three pets and nervously drifting off to sleep, The Nightmare Beast King remained conscious.

At this moment, it had retracted its dreadful majesty of the king level completely, except for its huge and majestic body size. The rest of its power seemed to have fallen silent.

But if you looked carefully, you could see that this tranquility was like the calm before a storm, hiding a surging power.

The Nightmare Beast King wasn’t in its usual spot in the core of the N0.97 Beast Realm, the forest where it and its kin resided, but was in a massive cave deep underground.

Cancan would have been surprised to find that this cave was the very one where it had completed its evolution.

A humongous earth-attribute dragon of king-level lay in front of the Nightmare Beast King, already cold but still instilling fear.

The Nightmare Beast King stepped forward and gently rested its wings on the king’s carcass.

Even in death, the earth king’s body still responded to the presence of its killer, emitting faint energy fluctuations as if expressing hatred that hadn’t diminished, even in death.

However, what it couldn’t do in life, it certainly couldn’t do in death.

A hint of coldness flashed in the eyes of the Nightmare Beast King.

“Caw-”

Let your death be of some meaning.

The power of the super ability attribute rippled around it. The next moment, mysterious symbols appeared on the earth king’s body, quickly draining the last bit of its power, which covered the inner wall of the cave.

The power derived from the earth enveloped everything around, forming a windproof, flawless cocoon, hiding all fluctuations of power.

Having done this, the Nightmare Beast King gently flapped its wings, shattering the now hollow corpse of the earth king into ashes that fell into a corner of the cave. It then flapped its wings again, and resources fell in front of it one by one.

Any of these resources contained powerful energy fluctuations. The one at the top radiated a majesty even more terrifying than that of the Nightmare Beast King itself.

This was a majesty that the Beast King could not possess, a majesty inherent to the Emperor Species!

It was a resource… of the Beast Emperor tier!

“Caw ”

Whether it would be successful or not, it all came down to this one attempt.

Even though the Nightmare Beast King, who had long been accustomed to hiding its emotions beneath the surface, had a glint of excitement flashing in its eyes at this moment.

It has been scheming for so long, and finally, it is about to take this step.

It was getting closer.

Once the evolution was complete, all the struggles should come to an end.

A terrifying power began to surge within the cave, but was completely hidden by the power covering the cave walls, preventing any Transcendent Beings from sensing any fluctuations in this area.

The evolution of the Nightmare Beast King, was starting.

In the No. 97 Beast Realm Core Area, there was a gigantic active volcano.

This active volcano incessantly spewed out horrifying heat waves and toxic fumes from its crater. Even ordinary Transcendent Beings would face the danger of perishing just by getting close.

At this moment, a powerful Transcendent Being stood by the crater of this volcano. Despite being one of the fire attribute Transcendent Beings with the best resistance to high temperatures, and even though its strength had already reached the General stage, this was the limit of where it could stay.

This Transcendent Being was kneeling, its head bowed low, facing the direction of the volcano crater, continuously making noises, as if telling a story.

A moment later, the heat wave erupting from the volcano crater suddenly became more aggressive, the continuously erupting smoke forced this General stage Transcendent Being to retreat a bit.

“Roar-”

You’re saying… the Nightmare is hiding something from this king?

A deep and terrifying roar echoed from inside the volcano.

The next moment, a massive skull slowly emerged from the crater, its head covered with golden red magma, which quickly slid down as it raised its head, eventually revealing its dark red scales and the mottled traces on them.

Following that, the formidable claws and body of this giant beast were revealed.

Finally, it completely walked out from the lava where even ordinary Transcendent Beings could hardly survive if they got too close. From its towering position, it looked down upon its subordinate, and its king-stage majesty skyrocketed.

One of the Six Kings of the No. 97 Beast Realm – the Lava Beast King! @@novelbin@@

The subordinate of the General stage trembled under the enormous majesty, until the Lava Beast King withdrew its momentum. It finally calmed down and made a hoarse voice.

“Hisss??? ”

King, in recent times, there have been many abnormal activities from the Nightmare Beast King’s subordinates. Based on these observations, I deduced that the Nightmare Beast King might have some other plans.

After speaking, the General stage subordinate lowered his head a bit further.

There was something else he didn’t say.

The Nightmare Beast King is the only Super ability Attribute Beast King among the Six Kings, with the highest wisdom in the entire Beast Realm. Undoubtedly, its plans would not be simple.

But this, the subordinate wouldn’t say.

Because the Lava Beast King standing in front of it was the most volatile and murderous among the six kings.

A statement carrying such implications could instantly provoke the Lava Beast King, turning it into a skeleton in the lava.

After hearing the subordinate’s words, a trace of disdain flashed in the eyes of the Lava Beast King.

That old sly Nightmare must be up to no good.

“Roar!”

Let’s test it out a bit!

“Hisss-”

King, how should we test it? Should we enter the territory of the Nightmare Beast King?

The subordinate of the General stage couldn’t help but look up at the Lava Beast King.

In the Beast Realm, disputes never cease.

As leaders of six different groups, the Six Kings naturally couldn’t always coexist peacefully. They each had their own territories, and casually entering the territory of other kings was an extremely serious provocation.

If that was what the king wanted to do, the consequences could be severe.

The Lava Beast King grunted, and intense heat waves rolled out.

“Roar-”

Didn’t you say that the Nightmare lost a daughter and hasn’t found her yet? If I remember correctly, you reported once that you found her in a human city.

If that’s the case… it’s reasonable for me to help the Nightmare find my niece, right?
