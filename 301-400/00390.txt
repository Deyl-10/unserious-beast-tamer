Chapter 390 - 239 Three New Store Clerks! _2

Chapter 390: Chapter 239 Three New Store Clerks! _2

“Let’s go, we have three new members to welcome today.” Xu Ran said quietly a sense of expectancy in his eyes, but alongside it, a hint of apprehension too. ’ Dear system, please don’t play any more tricks on me.

Hearing about the arrival of new members, the three little ones also perked up. Based on their previous experience, their first thought was about the system’s shop assistant rather than the contract pet beast.

So, after the previous three assistants, is the shop going to welcome three new system clerks?

Getting an affirmative reply from Xu Ran, the three little ones quickly got up and rushed towards the grooming station to start their grooming routine.

In a short while, the man and his three pets appeared in the shop area on the first floor of the Starfire Foster Shop.

“Are you ready?”

Xu Ran took a deep breath, looking back at his three little ones.

“Meow-” (I’m ready!)

Ziyun formally sat on the counter, its fluffy fur spreading out to both sides looking like an equilateral triangle head on. Its cute furry face was taut, showing a hint of nervousness.

The previous three shop assistants had not only brought a big shock to the customers but also to it.

This time, hopefully, there won’t be such strange humans anymore!

“Xi Lu~” (I’m also ready!)

Star nodded heavily, its eyes filled with thoughtful expressions at the same time.

In this moment, its thoughts started to diverge.

Given the situation at Qjngzhou City’s Starfire Foster Shop, three shop assistants alone could sustain a shop.

After gathering three assistants last time, Xu Ran took them to Xieyun City to open a new branch.

If it’s the same this time, does that mean the arrival of the three new shop assistants will mark their departure to another place?

Thinking this, anticipation shone in Star’s eyes.

If it s true, where would they be going this time?

“Charming!” (Let’sstart!)

Expectancy showed in Cancan’s eyes, and it couldn’t resist urging.

Unlike Star, it didn’t think too much, but just thought the previous three shop assistants were very interesting and wanted to see if this time’s shop assistants would be the same.

“Okay.” Xu Ran nodded, speaking softly, “I’m ready, too.”

The question he had just asked was not only for the three little ones, but also for himself.

He just hoped the system shop assistants would be a bit more normal!

In the frenzy of mental yelling, Xu Ran pressed down heavily to receive the reward.

A light door appeared abruptly in front of him and the three little ones, slowly opened, and with the sound of footsteps approaching from afar, the first figure emerged from the door.

Xu Ran’s gaze landed on the newcomer immediately.

Then, he couldn’t help but let out a little sigh of relief.

Thank goodness, the system did a good job this time.

The maid-coat shop assistant he had been hoping for appeared!

And, it was cat-ear cat-tail version!

Looking at the cute-looking shop assistant with her moving ears and slightly swinging cat tail, Xu Ran took a deep breath.

Could these be real?

“Meow?” (Is she a cat, too?)

After curiously looking around for a moment, Ziyun jumped off the counter and walked leisurely to her, showing a surprised look at the tail moving freely. It seems that way.” Xu Ran nodded, looking at the shop assistant “You …”

A slightly coquettish little girl voice came at this moment.

“Hello boss-”

“Good… Hello!” Xu Ran’s smile intensified.

Indeed she is a cat-eared maid-coat shop assistant, system you…

Wait a moment!

The smile on his face faltered.

Because it seemed that the one who spoke was not the cat-eared maid in front of him, but the figure who followed closely behind, emerging from the light door.

Seeing the overweight middle-aged man with a full beard on his chubby face, half of Xu Ran’s smile disappeared, “Were you talking just now?”

“Yes, boss, it was him!” A tough, wild voice like a hoarse northwestern man came at that moment.

The smile on Xu Ran’s face disappeared completely.

He looked at the cat-eared maid who spoke afterwards, then at the bearded big man who had spoken before, and held his head in pain.

“No! Tell me this isn’t real!”

The system has really sent him another unorthodox store clerk!

“Boss! Boss, what’s wrong with you?”

“Do you need me to massage your temples for you?”

“lean do it too…”

Seeing the pained expression on Xu Ran’s face, the two newly appeared system clerks quickly showed their concern and rushed to his side, chattering away.

Looking at the cat-eared maid clerk and the chubby, bearded clerk alternately speaking in rough, wild voices and delicate, cute voices, Xu Ran felt suddenly better.

Well…

When the two of them spoke together, it felt a lot more normal. @@novelbin@@

Just pretend to fool himself…

“I’m fine.” Xu Ran sighed, looking at the two, “You two, introduce yourselves.”

“Reporting to the boss, my name is Meow Meow!”

“Reporting to the boss, my name is Murong!”

The two system clerks simultaneously opened their mouths.

“Very good.” Xu Ran nodded slightly.

Although the voices and appearances of these two didn’t match, their behavior was quite normal.

Already numb from the baptism of teacher Tony, he had become somewhat accustomed to it.

Xu Ran couldn’t help but look towards the still silent light door.

After so long, why hasn’t the third clerk come yet?

“Is the boss waiting for the third colleague?” Noticing Xu Ran’s gaze, Murong smiled. “He’ll probably take a while.”

It seems you know each other.” Xu Ran glanced at Murong, “Why hasn’t he appeared yet?”

“Unless things go wrong…” Murong paused slightly, a hint of mischief in his

eyes, “His arrival depends on his luck with fishing.”

“…Huh?” Xu Ran’s mouth twitched slightly.

It doesn’t sound like he’s a very serious person either.

“In that case, let’s assign you tasks first.” Xu Ran shook his head slightly,

“What are you both good at?”

“Boss, I’m better at training.” Murong raised his chubby hand, volunteering enthusiastically.

However, his babyish voice made for a bizarre combination.

Training, huh…

Xu Ran stroked his chin, looking at Meow Meow at his side. “And you?”

“Reporting to the boss! I’m better at washing and grooming!” Meow Meow raised his hand high and spoke excitedly, his tail wagging behind him, making him appear particularly playful and cute.

If only he didn’t speak.

“Good at washing and grooming.” Xu Ran nodded slightly, “You can wash and

groom without talking.”

“If that’s the case, let’s see whether the clerk who hasn’t appeared yet is good

at fostering and feeding.” Xu Ran looked back at the light door.

Before long, the sound of urgent footsteps coming from the light door grew louder. They had a sticky quality, as if someone wearing wet slippers was walking at a brisk pace.

In no time, accompanied by a faint fishy smell, a man wearing a straw hat briskly walked out of the light door carrying a basket of fish in one hand and a fishing rod on his shoulder, smiling joyously.

“Hello, boss!” He greeted Xu Ran, quickly scooped out a vigorously struggling

Elite Stage Dragon Pattern Carp from the basket.

“Agreeting gift!”

Looking at the thrashing Dragon Pattern Carp in his hand, Xu Ran fell silent for a moment.

Is this the fish he caught?

If things go as expected, this clerk should be good at feeding…

Right?

“What’s your name?”

“Boss, call me Fisherman!”

“Fisherman, huh…” Xu Ran looked at the third clerk, “From now on, feeding will be your responsibility.”

“I’ve got it covered!” The Fisherman pounded his chest, making a thumping sound, “By the way, boss, have you chosen a shop manager?”

Having said that, the Fisherman glanced at Meow Meow and Murong, his smile suddenly turning mischievous.

“Boss, you wouldn’t want to put these two in charge of receiving customers would you?”

Xu Ran’s mouth twitched slightly.

System, what kind of store clerks have you found for me!
