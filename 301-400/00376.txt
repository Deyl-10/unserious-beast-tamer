Chapter 376: Chapter 230: Meet The Team Again 1

“Thank you for coming again-”

Xu Ran waved cheerfully to his departing customer but was met with a resentful gaze.

“Next time I come, I guess I’ll be greeted by Teacher Tony again, right?”

“Ah, well…” Xu Ran’s lips twitched slightly, “Unless something unexpected happens, yes.”

“Well, although Teacher Tony is really weird, I’ll still come again.” The customers sighed deeply and reluctantly left the foster shop.

“It seems that Teacher Tony has left a significant psychological shadow on the clients in Qingzhou City.” Xu Ran rubbed his chin, murmuring softly.

“It’s all the system’s fault!”

After successfully blaming the system, he suddenly felt better. Sensing that there was a new movement outside the shop, Xu Ran quickly got up and began to greet his guest, “Welcome…”

Having a clear look at the visitor, Xu Ran’s voice abruptly stopped, his smile becoming radiant, “Boss Cat, long time no see.”

“Chirp-” (I brought them here!)

The Velvet Sparrow hopped down from Boss Cat’s shoulder, its feathers bristling with discontent as it hopped up to Xu Ran.

“Alright, alright, I acknowledge your contribution,” said Xu Ran, ruffling the head of the Velvet Sparrow, before turning his attention back to Boss Cat, “You want a wash and care session?”

“Meow!”

Boss Cat nodded firmly, eyes filled with anticipation, and reached for its small bag tied around its waist.

“Eh, there’s no need for that. Just like before, it’s on the house.”

Xu Ran quickly interjected.

“Meow-”

Boss Cat shook its head and determinedly took out some money from its bag, counting it before placing it on the counter.

“Chirp-” (Boss Cat says it’s making money now and can afford this.)

The Velvet Sparrow casually translated for them.

“Alright then.” Xu Ran nodded reluctantly.

Since joining the Tiger Hunting Squad, indeed, Boss Cat wouldn’t be short of money.

Speaking of which, it had been a while since he saw the other members of the hunting squad and Lucky Liu, he wondered how they were doing.

No sooner had he thought of this than he heard a familiar voice outside.

“Boss Xu! We’re here!”

Soon, one by one, familiar figures entered the shop.

With the addition of Boss Cat, the entire Tiger Hunting Squad had arrived.

“Boss Cat told us you were back, so we all came over,” laughed Liu Gu. “It’s not that Teacher Tony is bad, it’s just that we’re used to Boss Xu’s delicate touch.”

“Last time when Teacher Tony cared for Wind Lion Dog, you were buddy-buddy with him. You guys even experienced his special Thai massage,” Yan Fan exposed on the side, trying to make Liu Gu awkward.

“Um…” Liu Gu scratched the back of his head, trying to defend himself, “I was just being polite to Teacher Tony!”

This caused the others to burst out laughing.

“Long time no see, it seems like you all are doing well.” Looking at everyone’s relaxed and jovial atmosphere that’s just like old times, a faint smile surfaced on Xu Ran’s face. “You can wait in the lounge, I’ll take care of you one by one.”

After saying this, Xu Ran gestured for Boss Cat to follow him.

“Meow-”

I am first.

Boss Cat politely nodded to its now-familiar companions, then followed Xu Ran into the grooming room.

Not long after, strange noises filled the grooming room as Boss Cat attempted to hide its embarrassment and discomfort.

“Meow???? ”

“Take care! See you next time!”

Watching the members of the Tiger Hunting Squad leave, Xu Ran’s face was all smiles.

In the process of providing care for each member’s pet beasts, Xu Ran was updated on Boss Cat’s happenings after its recruitment into the Tiger Hunting Squad by the squad members.

Without strays becoming a burden, life was completely different for Boss Cat.

Currently, Boss Cat had moved all its precious items to a corner in the large plaza at the city gate.

Initially, the hunting teams expressed some dissatisfaction, but this quickly disappeared with Boss Cat’s intimidating prowess and the support of the Tiger Hunting Squad. Admittedly, the Beast Master Association’s stance played a crucial part too.

Considering Boss Cat’s past merits, what harm would a small corner of the plaza make?

With a new place to call home, Boss Cat quickly adapted to its new lifestyle.

Whenever the Tiger Hunting Squad left the city, it would follow them around. The resources it received — besides purchasing food for itself — didn’t have any other noteworthy uses.

Having a lifestyle that was not demanding yet easily satisfied.

As a pet beast breed known for their fondness of sleep, now Boss Cat could dedicate sixteen hours a day to slumber. The remaining time was spent casually strolling around, effectively killing time. @@novelbin@@

The city gate plaza, frequented by the hunting squad, was bustling with activity.

In several ambush operations completed with the Tiger Hunting Squad, Boss Cat made significant contributions.

This tough bundle of fur — who had shown remarkable skill proficiency over the past several years, having achieved the halo tier for all skills — would have dominated the Beast Trainer Ranking in Xieyun City just based on its skill level alone, if only it could have evolved.

It’s robust fighting power enabled the Tiger Hunting Squad to undertake less challenging tasks meant for Leadership Level hunting squads, thereby significantly increasing the team’s overall earnings and making them all richer.

The big house that Du Heng had been unable to buy was finally purchased, complete with a massive yard, so the Armored Rhinoceros no longer needed to be fostered.

This morning, Xu Ran didn’t see the big creature.

Seeing his old friend’s life getting better and better, Xu Ran was genuinely pleased.

Stretching out, Xu Ran gazed at the direction of Xieyun City and muttered under his breath.

“I wonder how things are with Master Tony.”

Xieyun City.

Two figures stood outside the Starfire Foster Care Shop.

“Brother Zhang, is this pet care shop really as amazing as you said?” The younger of the two looked at the open door of the Starfire Foster Care Shop, curious, “I haven’t heard of this place before?”

“That’s because you’re uninformed!” The man referred to as Brother Zhang laughed heartily, “You haven’t been paying attention to the Leadership Level Beast Master rankings, have you?”

“Well, no. After all, I’m just at the Elite Level.” The young man scratched his head, “What’s up with the Leadership Level Beast Master rankings?”

“Hey, there’s been something big going on in the Leadership Level Beast Master rankings these past days.” Brother Zhang began excitedly, “Fang Yuling, daughter of Chairman Zhang, had been the current rank one in both the Individual Combat Power and the Pet Beast Team Power rankings.”

“But now, her position at the top was snatched away overnight!”

“Not only that, the person who took her spot is also the current first on the Individual Combat Power ranking, which makes them the triple number one!” “Huh?” The young man’s eyes showed surprise and disbelief, “There’s someone that amazing? What’s their name?”

“Their name is…” Brother Zhang had a mischievous look in his eyes, “Starfire Foster Care Shop.”

Young man:”???”

He blinked, looking at the shop named “Starfire Foster Care Shop” not far away, his face filled with confusion, “Brother Zhang, is this some sort of new joke?”

“No, no, no. The Beast Master’s name really is Starfire Foster Care Shop because he’s the owner of that shop.” Zhang pointed towards the nearby Starfire Foster Care Shop.

“And this shop, it blew up in popularity in a short period, trust me, its services are much better than any pet care shop in Xieyun City.”

“Really?” The young man’s face showed a trace of skepticism, but he couldn’t help his growing curiosity about the shop in front of him, “Let’s go and see then.”

“Good!” Brother Zhang nodded heavily, a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes.

Hook, line and sinker!

Soon, this sheltered lad will experience firsthand the mighty Tony!

The pair of them walked into the Starfire Foster Care Shop.

A moment later, a voice of fear could be heard from inside the shop.

“You… Don’t come over here!!!”

Similar situations were happening all over Xieyun City.

Those who had come to see this prodigal Beast Master, Xu Ran, after his triple ranking feat, were later surprised to find that he was nowhere to be seen. Instead, three unusual shop clerks had taken over, causing each of them to wear pained expressions.

Shopping at the Starfire Foster Care Shop had suddenly become a painful yet pleasurable experience.

While the value for service was far beyond any other foster shop in Xieyun City, the mental attack inflicted by the shop clerks on the customers and their pet beasts was immense.

As they left the Starfire Foster Care Shop, all of them had the same thought. They couldn’t be the only ones to suffer!

It was time to randomly select a few lucky ones to share in their agony.

With that thought in mind, these customers quickly found various excuses to bring their friends along.

Unfortunately, that tactic soon fell through.

Because the news travel fast.

The folks who knew about the Starfire Foster Care Shop quickly learned of the change in shop clerks and their distinctive style.

Aside from a minor few who became even more excited, the majority of the customers did not fall into the pit dug by their friends.

Left without a choice, these customers who’d wanted to bring their friends along turned their sights onto another group.

Those who had not been paying attention to the Leadership Level Beast Master rankings and didn’t know about the Starfire Foster Care Shop due to various reasons.

The pain didn’t lessen, but it could be spread!

For instance, at the sight of his friend’s pained and reluctant face, Brother Zhang’s smile returned.

“Master Tony, care to give him a grooming service, it’s my treat!”

That night, as the business hours came to an end, Xu Ran sent off the last customer, stretched, closed the shop door, and exhaled, “Phew! Finally done.”

His face displayed an overjoyed expression.

Many familiar faces had come because of the news. On top of running the business, he also found out about a lot of things that had happened during his half-month absence.

He casually opened his task list and began going through it like always.

The next moment, his smile froze.
