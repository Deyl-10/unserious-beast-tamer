Chapter 770 - 365: The Archangel Accuses, Semi-Saints Clash!_2

The Tortoise of Longevity, always watchful of the situation behind it, remained outwardly calm but inwardly chuckled, having already perceived some clues.

As an entity born alongside the Demon Wood Demigod, it could be considered the most knowledgeable being about the Demon Wood Demigod in this world Just now, the trial might have seemed in favor of the Upper Realm Demigod, but what it shattered was merely the diluted power that the Demon Wood Demigod projected over the Monster Wooden Domain.

If they were to truly face off, it would likely be at a disadvantage.

If this were not the case, the proud Upper Realm Demigod would not have voluntarily restrained its aura.

However, in a flash, the Tortoise of Longevity became pensive.

What did it matter if it were stronger than this Upper Realm Demigod?

In the Beast Field number eight, there were plenty of Beast Saints, and the number of Demigods was probably close to triple digits already. Such formidable strength was simply not something the current Monster Wooden Domain could contend with, even if humans from this domain were to join the fight, it would still be insufficient.

This Upper Realm Demigod was merely a messenger representing the Upper Realm.

And the Demon Wood Demigod also wanted to see the Upper Realm’s attitude.

That was of the utmost importance.

Under the guidance of the Tortoise of Longevity, the Upper Realm party soon arrived at the most central area of the Monster Wooden Domain, a place that was spacious and brimming with life.

An ancient tree covered in cyan-gold patterns had taken root here, its Wheel of Life reaching the sky, turning slowly like the hands of a clock, and the magnificent power it emanated suffused every corner of the Monster Wooden Domain.

The Beast Emperor from the Upper Realm Demigod’s kin, who had previously been clamorous about "False Saint," was now silent, and the other three Upper Realm Beast Emperors were also silent.

After all, this was a genuine Transcendent Being at the Demigod level, and even without the recognition of Beast Field number eight, they were not qualified to insult it.

The only one in the field who had the right to communicate on an equal footing with it was the Upper Realm Demigod.

A cyan-golden face materialized out of the void, as the Demon Wood Demigod gazed at the recently encountered Demigod, "A guest as you come, how may I address you?" Your next chapter is on empire

"Cloud Crow," the Upper Realm Demigod spoke slowly, its form slightly blurred, like a strange bird hidden within the clouds, mysterious dark gold patterns would flicker from time to time, and the terrifying aura it leaked was enough to cause palpitations.

"Cloud Crow Demigod, what brings you to Beast Field number 47?" the Demon Wood Demigod asked with a smile, looking serene.

After a moment of silence, Cloud Crow too chuckled, "Rumor has it that Beast Field number 47 is in disarray, the Beast Race is at war with itself, I am here by the name of the Beast Saint to investigate the truth."

"Oh," the Demon Wood Demigod’s face showed sudden realization, "So it’s about that."

"To not hide from Cloud Crow Demigod, those rumors are unfounded," it said, adopting a more righteous expression, "It’s merely personal vengeance that led to the fall of two Beast Emperors, how can it be called turmoil? As for the collapse of order, that’s even less likely."

"In Beast Field number 47, the Beast Race lives in even more harmony than before."

"Since you put it that way, then I will tentatively believe you," Cloud Crow Demigod nodded slightly, as if not taking the matter seriously at all.

The two Beast Emperors who had followed closely behind it now looked anxious.

Didn’t they agree to question the Demon Wood Demigod about its crimes?

How come after just a few words from the Demon Wood Demigod, Cloud Crow Demigod let it go so easily?!

They wanted to say something but felt multiple presences locking onto them.

Those were the other few Beast Emperors arriving from all over the Monster Wooden Domain.

At this moment, the way they looked at the two Beast Emperors was somewhat menacing.

As if having put the matter aside, Cloud Crow Demigod changed the topic, "Speaking of which, how long has it been since you broke through to the Demigod realm?"

The Demon Wood Demigod narrowed its eyes slightly, pondering for a moment before replying, "Two months."

"Two months, huh…" Cloud Crow Demigod, who had been all smiles a second ago, suddenly burst with an intense aura. Behind it, the Wheel of Life spun rapidly, and a horrifying presence condescendingly descended.

"All sacred beings had given a clear order, within the jurisdiction of the eighth Beast Field, all newborn members of the Holy Spirit Race must visit the sacred beings in the eighth Beast Field within a month."

"Why have you not gone, do you not hold the sacred beings in high regard?"

It has come!

All Beast Emperors belonging to the lineage of the Monster Wooden Demigods had a simultaneously solemn expression, feeling a sudden heaviness in their hearts.

The challenge from the other side had finally arrived!

The earlier light treatment by the Cloud Crow Demigod was just a prelude to this moment.

Clearly, they too knew that the so-called collapse of order, and internal chaos in the Beast Field, were not convincing enough to command obedience.

Has the eighth Beast Field ever truly cared for the life and death of other Beast Fields in its arrogance?

Only the disrespect towards the sacred beings by the newborn members of the Holy Spirit Race is considered significant enough for the eighth Beast Field to pay attention to.

The challenge posed by the Cloud Crow Demigod at this moment was an oppression in attitude.

Its goal was to force the Monster Wooden Demigod to submit using the authority of the sacred beings.

After all, it had said "I’ll temporarily believe" the Monster Wooden Demigod.

If the Monster Wooden Demigod submitted, willing to accompany it to the eighth Beast Field, then the sin of disrespect towards the sacred beings would naturally dissipate, and the previously mentioned crimes of collapsing order and internal chaos in the Beast Field would also be fully believed, treated with a light hand.

If the Monster Wooden Demigod did not submit, the sin of disrespecting the sacred beings would be affirmed, and the words of the Monster Wooden Demigod would no longer be credible, with the previous crime also falling upon its head.

But the question is, could the Monster Wooden Demigod really go to the eighth Beast Field?

Its stance was different from the sacred beings of the eighth Beast Field, being closer to humans, willing to coexist peacefully and establish a new order. Just this point alone was enough for the sacred beings to harbor malice towards it.

Not to mention that the power attribute of the Monster Wooden Demigod’s transcendence was order.

If a being with such a powerful attribute as the Monster Wooden Demigod truly became a Beast Saint one day, it would instantly become one of the strongest among the Beast Saints, a threat that the sacred beings naturally could not ignore.

Saint is a level of strength, not a spiritual plane.

These old fellows capable of cataclysmic destruction were not necessarily broad-minded.

Therefore, should the Monster Wooden Demigod enter the eighth Beast Field, it would at the very least be imprisoned; at worst, it could die on the spot.

Faced with the sudden grilling of the Cloud Crow Demigod, the Monster Wooden Demigod remained calm and collected, "This is a grave misunderstanding."

"The sacred beings of the Upper Realm are the strongest of our Beast Race, how dare I disrespect them?"

"However, the journey is long and arduous, and as a plant-based Transcendent Being, I am naturally not adept at traveling. Furthermore, I have just broken through and my current realm is unstable; I fear a careless move could cause me to fall back to the Emperor Stage, becoming a laughingstock. I do not wish to waste the precious time of the sacred beings of the Upper Realm."

"Therefore, I hope the Cloud Crow Demigod will report back to the Upper Realm, that once my realm is completely stable and I truly step into the Holy Spirit Race, then I will visit the sacred beings." The Monster Wooden Demigod spoke with great humility, "At this moment, I am merely a False Saint, and it would be improper to visit them hastily."

Even the Cloud Crow Demigod was stunned by the shameless words of the Monster Wooden Demigod.

Do you even listen to what you’re saying?

Just broke through and the foundation is unstable, not yet a true member of the Holy Spirit Race?

You might drop at any moment, you’re just a False Saint, so it’s improper to visit hastily?

Oh, and the term "False Saint" is one you coined yourself.

Thinking to this point, even the Cloud Crow Demigod found themselves momentarily at a loss for words, unsure of how to respond.@@novelbin@@
