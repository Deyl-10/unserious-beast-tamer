Chapter 726 - 346: Trace Of The Star Town_2

The momentum had slightly diminished, but the Ghost Bat had not sustained significant damage from the recent strike, its crimson eyes filled with surprise and suspicion—clearly, it had not expected Ziyun’s skills to be so terrifying.

Without paying heed to the Ghost Bat’s reaction, a miss prompted Ziyun to instantly shift her gaze to the side, towards the Dark Demon Lion that was rapidly pouncing towards her, surrounded by a sky-high dark blaze.

"Roar——"

With a ferocious roar, the Dark Demon Lion quickly spat out a dark flame that had been ready to launch from its mouth, enveloping Ziyun like a cannon blast. The deep black light completely swallowed her.

-----------------

"Boom!!!"

Almost simultaneously as the black light engulfed Ziyun, a violent thunderous sound came from behind.

The silent Ink Scale Leopard had not targeted Ziyun as its first attack; instead, it locked its gaze onto the remaining person and four beasts from the beginning of the battle.

At this moment, as the thunderous sound resounded, starlight-woven patterns rapidly dimmed, and rock walls that rose from the ground were shattered inch by inch, without time for them to heal.

Even the combined defensive power of Starlight and Cancan barely managed to fend off the Ink Scale Leopard’s assault.

"Chah!!!"

Cancan, filled with both alarm and rage, suddenly raised a claw. Woven with a halo sharp enough to grind anything in its path, she pressed it down fiercely towards the Ink Scale Leopard.

The light pattern, woven from starlight, converged on Cancan’s body, and with the blessing of the Star God Blessing, her momentum climbed with every fall of the massive claw.

In that moment, Cancan was deeply troubled but unable to voice it.

The abyss could barely accommodate its original body type, which meant Cancan could not use Heaven-Earth Law to maximize its size; she even had to slightly shrink her body, or she would be severely restricted in movement at the bottom of the abyss.

Since its strength had not yet reached the full maturity of the King Stage, it was exceedingly difficult for it to face the Ink Scale Leopard head-on.

Watching the massive claw fall, the Ink Scale Leopard’s crimson eyes flashed with a hint of seriousness—it could feel that this power was a threat to itself.

The black mist around its claws grew denser, almost completely enveloping its limbs. The Ink Scale Leopard turned into a shadow and swiftly dodged to the side.

Two cold blade lights fell from the sky, coordinating with Cancan’s giant claw, attempting to seal the Ink Scale Leopard’s range of motion.

The next instant, an inexplicable drowsiness surged, causing the Ink Scale Leopard’s body to stiffen.

-----------------

"Zzzt——"

A piercing sound of electric light tore through the void. Ziyun appeared unscathed in another part of the void after being fully struck by the Dark Demon Lion, immediately turning her head back towards the direction of the person and four beasts with a flash of urgency and concern in her eyes.

"You should worry about yourself!"

Accompanied by a taunting sneer, dark blade edges, along with the Ghost Bat’s wing flaps, burst densely from the void and instantly enveloped all the space where Ziyun could dodge, like a curtain of rain.

The very void twisted slightly under these blades, their terrifying momentum overwhelming the skies.

"Meow!" (It’s you who should be worried about yourself!)

Ziyun retorted unceremoniously while the thunderbolt pattern on her forehead instantly burst forth with blinding brilliance.

Countless serpentine bolts of lightning abruptly materialized around Ziyun’s body and pounced on the incoming blades. Accompanied by consecutive thunderous sounds, they swiftly devoured the dark blades and, undiminished, counterattacked.

With one strike, Ziyun didn’t even look back at the result; she turned and thrust out a claw, heavily colliding with the approaching claw of the Dark Demon Lion that was ready to sneak attack from behind.

A huge "Thunder Punishment" rune interwove in the void, dark flames surged and reflected each other, the powers of the Thunder and Dark Attributes crushed against one another, eventually shattering into myriad fragments and scattered in the raging storm.

"Boom!!!"

With a deep thunderous roar, the Dark Demon Lion was sent flying backward, slamming heavily into the rock wall. The claw that collided with Ziyun spurting blood, white bones exposed, with continuous flashes of electric light.

Ziyun shook off her paw and, with a flicker of her form, appeared right in front of the Dark Demon Lion before it could react.

Ziyun raised her claw and grasped, and a thick, deep purple thunderbolt descended from the void, transformed into a terrifying thunder spear which she viciously thrust into the Dark Demon Lion’s belly, nailing it to the rock wall.

"Roar——"

The Dark Demon Lion let out a pitiful scream as its body convulsed continuously due to the violent invasion of the Thunderforce, a sizzling scent arose from the pierced belly, and the immediate severe injury caused it to lose its fighting capacity in an instant.@@novelbin@@

One down.

Ziyun’s figure flashed again; she was already facing the Ghost Bat, which was also looking slightly ragged.

The wide-range damage from Thunder Shocker forced it to avoid dispersal like it had against Thunder Punishment, reluctantly having to rely on other means to endure.

After this hit, its vitality visibly declined, its body streaked with electric lights that occasionally twitched, having been seriously injured.

"Spare me!" Seeing the Dark Demon Lion nailed to the rock wall, the Ghost Bat cried out in a panicked scream, but Ziyun chose to ignore it as though she had not heard.

Spare it?

Letting it go now, who knew if it would ambush everyone from the dark mist once they got out of the abyss?

Therefore, the Ghost Bat must not be spared!

In the continuous flashes, the fully charged Cloud Break Sky was unleashed from Ziyun’s raised claw, becoming the final blow to end the Ghost Bat.
