Chapter 775 - 368: The Upheaval Of The Yang Guang Cultivation Method

Over an endless expanse of wilderness, a jade-colored giant dragon with wings spanning a hundred meters soared by, whipping up wild winds that made the grass and trees sway and scatter, its fully released aura silencing all living creatures that perceived it.

A gentle energy flowed in front of the jade-colored giant dragon, dissolving the strong headwinds, allowing the two humans and a group of Pet Beasts on the dragon’s back to stand as if on solid ground, at ease.

Having temporarily resolved the issue with the Bright Group, Xu Ran let the five little ones rest and recuperate before sitting cross-legged on the back of the jade-colored giant dragon, with the contents of the Yang Guang Cultivation Method flashing through his mind once again.

The cultivation method left by the master of the Yang Guang Celestial Palace was different from the knowledge granted by the system, which could be fully understood at the time of impartation. It was more like an e-book tucked away in the mind, ready to be perused whenever thought directed.

Although Xu Ran had previously skimmed through it in haste, he had only tasted a morsel of it and realized the general scope of the Yang Guang Cultivation Method without delving deeper.

Now, taking advantage of the time Fang Canghai had fought for, he intended to master this cultivation method as much as possible.

According to the introduction of the Yang Guang Cultivation Method, the power obtained through the Beast Taming Contract’s feedback naturally resides within the flesh and transforms into a form of power called "vitality."

In another world, humans cultivate their own strength by simultaneously cultivating three different powers: "vitality," "Essence Force," and "Divine Sense."

Only by combining these three can one’s individual strength be fully harnessed.

Therefore, the strength of a Beast Master is in a peculiar situation, akin to walking on one leg—having an abundance of "vitality," but lacking the other two powers.

What the Yang Guang Cultivation Method does is guide this "vitality" to transform into "Essence Force" and "Divine Sense."

Although this approach might reduce the "vitality," the overall strength remains unchanged while greatly enhancing the Beast Master’s individual combat power.

Because "vitality" needs to be converted into two different forms, the Yang Guang Cultivation Method is divided into two parts, which can be practiced simultaneously without interference.

The first part is to sense the positions of one’s own meridians, gather the first droplet of Essence Force, and control it as it traverses a special trajectory through the meridians all over the body.

The circulation of Essence Force is quite peculiar; once it completes its first full circulation, it can be left to travel on its own without the risk of mishaps.

Vitality and Essence Force, these two powers, are like two sides of the same coin, intricately related to each other. Therefore, when the body is overly filled with vitality and has very little Essence Force, the vitality will naturally shift towards Essence Force, much like water flowing downhill.

Hence, one only needs to maintain the circulation of Essence Force to steadily continue the transformation until the quantities of vitality and Essence Force are nearly equal.

The second part involves converting vitality into Divine Sense, which is somewhat more complicated and requires a method known as visualization.

Unlike the Meditation Training of the Beast Master’s contract power, it involves mentally depicting a symbolically significant object and then continuously refining it, thereby enhancing Divine Sense during this process.

For the Yang Guang Cultivation Method, the visualization is that of a great sun, which is clearly described in Xu Ran’s brain, greatly reducing the difficulty of the first visualization.

Since Divine Sense is entirely separate from the body, it cannot be directly transformed from vitality; however, Essence Force acts as a medium between the two.

As it travels through the meridians near the brain, if the Essence Force is stronger than the Divine Sense, it will naturally convert into Divine Sense.

First, vitality is transformed into Essence Force, then Essence Force into Divine Sense, to finally achieve a balance of power among the three. This is the essence of the Yang Guang Cultivation Method.

After thoroughly understanding this, Xu Ran couldn’t help but marvel at the refinement of the cultivation methods from the other world and began his first attempt.

The physical quality of a King Level Beast Master made the threshold for initiation almost non-existent. With the guidance of the cultivation method, it didn’t take long for Xu Ran to sense all the hidden meridians in his body.

Next was the condensation of the first droplet of Essence Force.@@novelbin@@

Transitioning from nothing to something is often the most difficult part.

Xu Ran carefully sensed the hidden vitality within his body, striving to control the expansion and contraction of the meridians in order to extract the power of vitality bit by bit, like drawing water. Explore more at empire

About ten minutes passed, and a sound of a water droplet—the "ding-dong"—faintly emerged, bringing a joyful expression to Xu Ran’s face.

Success!

He could feel at this moment, three inches below his navel, Essence Force has gathered into the form of the first droplet, reaching the minimal requirements for the circulation of meridians.

Next, it was time to control the circulation of Essence Force within the meridians.

Compared to the previous process, this one was somewhat easier.

Within Xu Ran’s perception, this droplet of Essence Force, belonging to him, was as docile as a lamb, responding instantly to his will at the slightest thought.

After completing a full cycle of circulation following the meridian diagram of the Yang Guang Cultivation Method, Xu Ran withdrew his controlling force and felt Essence Force intelligently complete the second circulation on its own, which allowed him to relax.

That’s it?

Easy!

If the master of the Yang Guang Celestial Palace still had awareness, he would probably only be able to smile wryly at Xu Ran’s thoughts.

In his former world, a human novice to the cultivation methods needed one to seven days just to obtain the first droplet of Essence Force and even longer to complete the first circulation, with those less talented possibly needing a month.
