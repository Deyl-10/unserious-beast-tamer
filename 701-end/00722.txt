Chapter 727 - 346: Trace Of The Star Town_3

A strike descended, and only a short piece of the bat wing bone, emitting a dark glow, remained in the void.@@novelbin@@

Grabbing the bat wing bone casually, Ziyun returned to the Dark Demon Lion’s side, pulled out the Thunder spear pinning it down, and then grabbed the half-dead lion, flinging it towards Xu Ran and the other four little ones.

As the battle with Ziyun came to a close, the fight between one human and four Pet Beasts also reached an end.

Under the forced interference of the "Endless Sleep," the Ink Scale Leopard lost its only chance to make a full retreat. At the brink of life and death, between being smashed by a paw or grievously wounded by a blade, it chose the latter.

At the cost of bearing the brunt of Xu Ran’s slash, the Ink Scale Leopard managed to escape from the poised "Land of Destruction."

That slash left a deep bone-exposing wound on its body, blood flowing out as if it cost nothing, causing the leopard’s momentum to plummet rapidly, making even walking seem staggered.

Ziyun, on returning, raised its paw to give the Ink Scale Leopard a fierce battle, further worsening its already serious wounds, and then dragged it along with the Dark Demon Lion in front of Xu Ran like dragging dead dogs.

"I’ll ask, you’ll answer," Xu Ran began slowly, "Answer correctly and I might spare your lives; answer wrongly and your lives end here."

The barely conscious Dark Demon Lion, with a fading breath, exchanged a glance with the Ink Scale Leopard before speaking hoarsely, "Human, what do you want to ask?"

"Do you know about the Town Star Stone?"

"We know," the Dark Demon Lion replied slowly, its gaze flickering.

A gleam of deep light flashed across the red eyes of the Ink Scale Leopard, nodding quickly as well.

Excitement appeared in Star’s eyes, and she was about to continue asking when Xu Ran raised a hand to stop her.

"Let the two of them speak separately; if their stories differ, kill them both."

Having said that, Xu Ran crossed his arms and looked towards the lion and leopard.

These two fellows were very cunning.

As soon as these words were spoken, the expressions of the lion and leopard changed rapidly.

Ziyun and Cancan each took one and quickly interrogated them. After comparison, the details were almost identical.

-----------------

[Still lacking three thousand, overworking my liver]

A figure leisurely emerged from a cave in the distant rock wall, its cold eyes instantly fixating on one human and five beasts.

It was a leopard Pet Beast with pitch-black scales all over its body, shrouded in a thin veil of Darkness, with fierce and ferocious red eyes, exhibiting power fluctuations at the King Stage level.

Dark King Level· Ink Scale Leopard.

"Meow~" (Your mouth really is blessed.)

Ziyun glanced at Cancan before stepping forward, focusing her gaze on the Ink Scale Leopard with a display of her own aura, confronting it from afar.

This Ink Scale Leopard was not simple; its aura faintly transcended the Great Complement Beast King. Even if it couldn’t compare to the Nightmare Beast King, it was only slightly lower.

Such strength would be an almost invincible existence in the outside world at the Overlord stage; and yet, here in the Silent Abyss, the first Beast King they encountered possessed such power.

Fortunately, such an opponent was still not a threat to it.

But the next moment, Ziyun’s expression suddenly turned a bit grave.

Because after this Ink Scale Leopard appeared, another Beast King of similar strength emerged from another rock wall cave.

It was a lion whose body was ablaze with dark flames, its pitch-black eyes upon appearance firmly locked onto Ziyun, filled with wariness and hostility.

Dark King Level· Dark Demon Lion!

Two Quasi-domineering Level!

No, three!

Accompanied by a strange "crackle and pop" sound, the Darkness above churned and a bat-like creature, with a wingspan of more than twenty meters, flew out of the black fog, its crimson eyes fixating on the one human and five beasts below.

Dark King Level· Ghost Bat!

The expressions of the one human and five beasts changed slightly.

The aura of this Ghost Bat was unfamiliar, yet carried a hint of familiarity.

Several times, as they passed through the Darkness, similar auras attacked them, but those were much weaker and were disposed of by Ziyun before they could even appear.

Undoubtedly, the attackers hidden in the Darkness were closely related to the Ghost Bat before them.

Now, in this somewhat cramped space, the opponents that the one human and five beasts faced were unprecedentedly strong.

Even previously in Fallen Star Valley, they had only faced two Quasi-domineering Level Transcendent Beings at the same time.

And now, they were facing three.

"Hehehe~" The Ghost Bat’s cold gaze lingered on Ziyun, revealing an undisguised greed, "A King Stage Emperor Species, such a great tonic. Devouring you might give me the chance to evolve again."

"Along the way, you’ve killed quite a few of my kin," it spoke unhurriedly, "Now, it’s time for you to pay with your lives!"

"Human, coming here was your greatest mistake," the Dark Demon Lion spoke hoarsely, its eyes filled with severity, "The Silent Abyss is a forbidden zone for Humans!"

The Ink Scale Leopard did not speak, its aura simply growing more threatening.

"Meow~" (You all talk too much!)

Ziyun’s gaze flashed slightly, as countless bolts of thunder suddenly exploded around its body, resonating in the void; its body elementalized in an instant and, accompanied by a deep rumble echoing at the bottom of the Abyss, instantly appeared before the Ghost Bat.

A sharp claw, charged with immense power that sent shivers down the spine, was pressed down fiercely towards the Ghost Bat with an unpredictable might.

Four Stars Skill, Violent Sun Level· Thunder Punishment!

The Ghost Bat let out a screech; its body "popped" and dissolved into numerous smaller bats, scattering instantly.
