Chapter 801 - 382: A New Journey! (Grand Finale)

Evolution under the guard of faith does not require the presence of all the disciples.

The disciples of the "Dream God," personified by faith, naturally have a strong bond with Twelve.

Through this connection, disciples are able to transfer a special, mysterious power to Twelve—a power Twelve has named "Force of Faith."

With only a long-distance notification to all disciples through the connection between the two, preparing them to focus and transmit the Force of Faith, that alone qualifies as "under the guard of faith."

Now that Twelve has the requisite number of disciples, the evolution can be carried out at any time.

After communicating with the disciples for a moment with closed eyes, Twelve opened those sea-blue eyes, face filled with excitement and anticipation, and nodded at Xu Ran.

Xu Ran took a deep breath, took out the resources needed for Twelve’s evolution one by one, and placed them in front of it, "Go for it!"

"Cha~" (Go for it!)

Cancan emitted a sincere blessing. Having just successfully completed its own evolution, it now only hoped that Twelve’s evolution would be as smooth as its own.

The other three little ones also gave their blessings, and with the gaze of their little friends upon it, Twelve’s eyes grew determined. It rapidly consumed all the resources in front of it, then soared high, enveloped in torrential energy.

Countless dreamy sceneries passed by like bubbles, making Twelve’s form grow indistinct. Xu Ran and the other four little ones could only sense the agitated energy being swiftly smoothed and the momentum gradually intensifying.

Time passed, unnoticed, until the light of evolution pierced through the myriad illusions, lighting up the world.

When the light faded, emerged a giant bird with an elongated body and wings spanning more than ten meters, emitting a melodious cry.@@novelbin@@

Above its head, countless fragments floated, converging into a crown, also resembling an endless loop. Each fragment contained a corner of a splendid scene, and within each one was another giant bird of the same likeness.

At this moment, reality and fantasy blended.

Rushing to its friends’ side, the evolved Twelve still carried a hint of relief in its eyes.

Its evolution was far more perilous than anticipated, placing itself on the brink between reality and illusion, a huge risk.

If not for every talent skill merging with a Three Star Skill in the process of increasing its stars, if it hadn’t been for the Force of Faith of over ten thousand disciples serving as an anchor, it might have lost itself in the void between reality and hallucination, sinking completely.

"Fantastic!" Xu Ran looked at the reborn Twelve, grinning broadly.

Looking at Twelve’s brand new skills, Xu Ran couldn’t help but stroke his chin.

Twelve’s race name was Reflection of Virtual Realm.

Twelve’s talent skill was called Projection of the Virtual Realm.

To say there was no connection between the two—he didn’t believe it.

"Twelve, what does Projection of the Virtual Realm do?" Xu Ran asked curiously.

Hearing this question, a smile appeared in Twelve’s eyes.

It didn’t answer directly but lifted its head to gaze at the countless fragments above.

"Chiu~" (That is the Virtual Realm.)

After speaking, one of the fragments suddenly lit up.

Then, another Twelve from within that fragment instantly flew out, its ethereal figure overlapping with Twelve.

As Xu Ran and the other four watched in astonishment, Twelve’s presence soared instantaneously.

Although the rise wasn’t huge, seeing the countless fragments still in the sky, the group swallowed hard in unison.

"You’re not going to tell me that all these reflections can be projected onto you, are you?" Xu Ran couldn’t help but ask.

"Chiu~" (That’s right.)

Twelve’s affirmative reply made Xu Ran take a deep breath.

But immediately afterward, Twelve also explained the limitations of this skill. Continue reading on empire

Firstly, after the reflection’s descent, the corresponding fragment in the Virtual Realm would lose that reflection and couldn’t naturally recover. It could only be restored by Twelve constructing a new reflection in the Virtual Realm.

And the material for construction wasn’t anything else but the Force of Faith.

Moreover, the construction speed had to be fast.

If a Virtual Realm went too long without a reflection settling in, it would gradually slip out of Twelve’s control and eventually disappear completely.

This process of disappearance was irreversible.

In other words, how many reflections Twelve could summon instantly was not determined by the number of reflections, but by how many it could construct with the Force of Faith in a set time.

If it overfished the resources, Twelve would gradually lose Virtual Realms, and the strength of this skill would plummet quickly, even affecting its ability to use other skills.

Understanding the situation, Xu Ran became tense, "Twelve, do you have enough Force of Faith to construct a reflection?"

"Chiu~" (Don’t worry!)

Twelve gave Xu Ran a reassuring look.

It now had ten thousand disciples.

Their Force of Faith should be enough for it to descend ten reflections of the Virtual Realm without any side effects.
