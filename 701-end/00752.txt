Chapter 756 - 358: Yang Guang Celestial Palace!

"Pfft...purrji!" (So...so powerful!)

Clutching Bright Group tightly, Ziyun’s eyes widened as she watched Xu Ran effortlessly defeat a creature at the Quasi-domineering Level, her face filled with shock.

"Meow~" (It seems there really was something good in that stone pillar earlier.)

Ziyun also showed a hint of eagerness.

Previously, Xu Ran had to cooperate with Cancan after linking with the Star Power to kill a Quasi-domineering Level creature.@@novelbin@@

Now that Cancan had acquired a new Four Stars Skill, he could face a Quasi-domineering Level creature on his own, and Xu Ran’s strength had also surged after acquiring swordsmanship.

In that case, if it used the Immortal Body to turn into a long sword and fought alongside Xu Ran, what level of strength could they reach?

Almost at the same moment Ziyun thought of this, Xu Ran, who had just brandished his long sword, also looked in Ziyun’s direction, clearly having reached the same conclusion.

After carelessly flicking the supernatural resource left behind by the fallen Crow Beast King—a pitch-black claw bone—Xu Ran’s gaze then shifted toward the interior of the desert.

With the fall of the Crow Beast King, the atmosphere had not eased but had become even more tense.

The presences in the desert center that had locked onto Xu Ran from afar were now surging more violently.

They hadn’t come to the aid of the Crow Beast King, but having sensed its demise, they now had a certain understanding of Xu Ran’s strength and had become even more cautious, unwilling to act rashly.

"Let’s go, let’s go see what kind of resources are hidden inside," Xu Ran suggested softly, riding upon Star, not slowing down his pace into the depths, but instead gradually accelerating.

His actions clearly infuriated the existences that were covertly targeting him, as their auras surged even more violently.

The thick sandstorm in front of them was forcefully torn apart by Cancan’s Dragon Turtle’s Power one after another, revealing a bright light ahead that gradually became clearer.

Also becoming clearer were the massive, blurry figures around the light. Each of them possessed a power not inferior to that of the Crow Beast King.

A total of five Quasi-domineering Level creatures!

After the Crow Beast King had fallen, it was surprising for Xu Ran that there were still so many strong creatures here.

"Ziyun!"

Ziyun tossed Bright Group that was in her arms to a firefly by her side and dashed towards Xu Ran.

Bright Group felt its body spin rapidly a few times before falling into a fluffy embrace.

"Luho~" (Hello there~)

The firefly carefully held Bright Group and greeted it.

Sensing that the firefly’s presence was much weaker than Ziyun’s, Bright Group suddenly felt the relief of having survived a disaster, though it still wasn’t a creature it could defeat; at least the terrifying suffocation was gone.

It looked curiously at Ziyun, who was dashing forward, and couldn’t help but ask.

"Purrji~" (What is she going to do?)

"Luho~" (Big sister is going to fight alongside Xu Ran.)

The firefly spoke earnestly, its face full of anticipation and longing.

Seeing the expression on the firefly’s face, Bright Group blinked.

"Purrji?" (Can they win?)

The firefly glanced at the five figures, which were becoming clearer from being blurry.

Although they had never faced so many Quasi-domineering Level creatures together before, the firefly still had full confidence in its companions.

"Luho!" (They definitely can!)

Almost the instant the firefly’s words fell, Cancan’s Dragon Turtle’s Power tore through the last layer of sandstorm in front.

At the center of the desert covered by endless sand, where not a single grain of sand was present, and even some green plants grew as if stepping into another world.

The five figures of various sizes, all radiating the presence of the Quasi-domineering Level, stood in line, silently staring at the intruders before them.

With the Crow Beast King being killed in such a short time, none of them dared to fight alone at this moment. Without any communication, the five Quasi-domineering Level creatures tacitly chose to join forces.

Xu Ran rode on Star, charging at the five Quasi-domineering Level creatures at full speed.

His hands were empty; the ancient sword that had killed the Crow Beast King had been stowed behind him.

Not far from Xu Ran, a series of Thunderous Sounds accompanied by roars that shook the entire area and disturbed the surroundings materialized in an instant.

Flitting through the Lei Jing, a figure intertwining purple and white flickered constantly, chasing Xu Ran and Star. As it moved at an extreme speed, the invisible and imposing Power around it rolled up violent thunder into whirlwinds, wildly intertwining and converging.

This scene even diverted the five Quasi-domineering Level creatures’ attention from Xu Ran for a moment, as they seriously turned to look at Ziyun by his side.

King Stage·Emperor Species!

This terrible creature was not one any of them could withstand!

Together, if they did not give their all today, they would likely stay here forever!

"Damn humans, despicable traitor beasts!" With a terrifying roar, a Giant Dragon at the center charged towards Xu Ran first, "Attack together!"

To the left and right of the Giant Dragon, a Tiger with wings on its back and a Phoenix radiating golden light also took action at the same time.

Further away, a humanoid Transcendent Being holding a broadsword and another Transcendent Being with a body as nebulous as a mist coordinated with the other three.

In an instant, five different attacks rapidly fell towards Xu Ran, blocking all his escape routes. Within the overwhelming force, even the void twisted, and the extreme violence carried a heart-palpitating danger.
