Chapter 749 - 354: A Hidden Corner_2

The giant sword in its hand broke into two pieces from the middle, the blade stabbed into the earth, and the hilt lay beside.

Upon sensing the approach of one human and five Pet Beasts, the Armored Beast King’s body trembled slightly, struggling to stand up, but ultimately failed.

"Kill me," the voice of the Armored Beast King was filled with depth and hatred, "You treacherous scum, consorting with Humans, are surely seeking the tiger’s skin."

"Although I do not know where your deep hatred comes from..." Xu Ran calmly looked at the Armored Beast King, "have you not heard of the Beast Master?"

The Armored Beast King fell silent, even the struggle ceased momentarily.

After a moment, it spoke in a heavy voice, "What is a Beast Master?"

"Humans who contract with Transcendent Beings and command them in battle." Xu Ran paused briefly, "You just asked why Cancan helps me, because it is my contracted Pet Beast, fighting alongside me."

"Impossible!" The Armored Beast King’s body trembled violently, the tumultuous emotions causing its breath to grow even weaker, "This must be a Human trick, I have never heard of such a contract!"

"The feud between Humans and the Beast Race is irreconcilable!"

Experience more on empire@@novelbin@@

"Is it?" Xu Ran’s eyes narrowed.

He remembered some of the things Fang Canghai had mentioned when he first introduced this relic to him.

Some speculated that Transcendent Beings came from another world, and to this day, the entrance between that world and this one still exists, just undiscovered.

Transcendent Beings continually entered this world through the entrance, ensuring that despite their difficulties in procreation, their numbers did not dwindle in the enduring conflict with Humans.

And this relic most likely originated from that world.

So... is what the Armored Beast King spoke of the situation in that other world?

Xu Ran decided to lay his cards on the table in order to gain more crucial information.

"In fact, you are probably not in your original world right now," Xu Ran slowly began.

"In this world, the only Transcendent Power wielded by Humans is to contract with Transcendent Beings and to strengthen themselves through the mutual battle and nourishment from Transcendent Beings."

"Indeed, many Transcendent Beings harbor hatred towards Humans, attempting to exterminate them, and the battle between Humans and Transcendent Beings continues to this day."

"But there are also Transcendent Beings who try to coexist peacefully with Humans."

"And that is what we hope for."

"The idea that Humans reject all of the Beast Race does not exist."

"Another world..." The body of the Armored Beast King shook violently, clearly shocked by what Xu Ran had disclosed, "Is this some kind of deceit of yours?"

"It’s really not." Xu Ran shook his head slightly, and behind him, a massive Hexagram Star Array appeared, with five golden beams of light shooting out from the center of the array and landing on the five creatures, "You should be able to feel it, right?"

What he was using at this moment was the manifestation of the Beast Taming Contract.

This ability wasn’t much of use, but it allowed the Armored Beast King to clearly sense the connection between him and the creatures, and even to perceive the content of the Beast Taming Contract.

The Armored Beast King fell silent.

If all previous occurrences could be considered the cunning plots of the deceptive Human before it, upon seeing this so-called contract, it was forced to believe.

"Is the outside world... really no longer the world I once knew?" it murmured softly, its eyes filled with bewilderment, "What does the outside world look like now?"

"We’ll get to that later," Xu Ran said with a smile, "I’ve said quite a lot, now it’s your turn to share what you know, isn’t it?"

"I am very interested in what you mentioned about the final battle."

"The final battle..." The gaze of the Armored Beast King carried a hint of contemplation, "It was the battle where the fate of Humans and the Beast Race was decided."

"In that battle, our Beast Race lost and from then on was exiled to the harshest, most desolate, and barren regions of the continent, fenced in by Humans."

"Fenced in?" Xu Ran stroked his chin, "Then how did you end up in our world?"

"I do not know." The Armored Beast King shook its head with difficulty, "Most who personally experienced the final battle have passed away, and even if there were any, they would not be here."

"All of the Beast Race here was born in this place."

"All of our memories and hatred stem from the ancestral blood imprints."

"And these inherited memories do not contain information on how we came to be here."

"Chirp~" (No wonder your dreams are so chaotic.)

Twelve spoke suddenly.

If the hatred is derived from fragmented ancestral memories within their bloodlines, naturally, it would seem extremely chaotic when viewed.

This also explained why they, having never seen humans before, harbored such enmity towards them.

"Understood," Xu Ran nodded slightly.

Given this, it was probably difficult to get more information from the Armored Beast King.

It hadn’t experienced much, and many things were just fragmented memories inherited down the line.

Fortunately, these snippets of information were enough for Xu Ran to deduce some things.

In another world, humans and Transcendent Beings detested each other, leading to the so-called "final battle," after which the Transcendent Beings were exiled and restrained by humans.

And these exiled Transcendent Beings eventually appeared in this world.

The way they arrived here should be similar to how the ruins appeared in this place.

"One last question," Xu Ran glanced at the Armored Beast King, "Are there any humans from your world here?"

"No," the Armored Beast King shook its head without hesitation, then added after a pause, "But there are some things left behind by the humans."

"Oh?" Xu Ran’s eyes lit up, showing a look of surprise, "Where?"

The Armored Beast King fell silent, just gazing at Xu Ran.

"Star, heal," Xu Ran commanded with a wave of his hand.

"Xi Lu~"

Star neighed, and the Star Chain connected to the Armored Beast King instantaneously, repairing the shattered armor around its body in just a few breaths, and even the great sword was restored to its former glory.

Its aura surged to the heavens but it merely stood in place with its sword, no longer attacking Xu Ran and the group.

"We have come here to explore, with no intention of wanton slaughter," Xu Ran spoke slowly, "Now, can you tell us what the humans from your world left behind here?"

"Go straight in that direction, and you will find a ruin," the Armored Beast King pointed in a certain direction, "That’s what was left by the humans."

"Initially, it wasn’t a ruin but rather a secret place of the humans."

"However, due to the hatred towards humans, any passing member of the Beast Race would vent their fury, and incidentally search for anything of use, turning it into a ruin over time."

Xu Ran: "..."

It didn’t sound like there would be anything good left.

This relic had been around for who knows how long, and at least a thousand Transcendent Beings had passed through, each pilfering it — what could possibly be left?

"Let’s go take a look anyway," Xu Ran said resignedly with a shake of his head and a bit of vain hope, turning towards the direction indicated by the Armored Beast King.

The Armored Beast King watched silently as the man and five Pet Beasts departed until they vanished from sight, then turned back to its original guardian spot, leaving behind only a sigh.

"Another world, huh..."

-----------------

"Xi Lu?"

Xu Ran and the five little ones were making their way through the dense jungle in the direction pointed out by the Armored Beast King, when Star suddenly stopped, turned its head sharply, and looked in a certain direction.

"What’s wrong?" Noticing Star’s unusual behavior, Xu Ran asked curiously.

"Xi Lu~" (I just felt like something was following us.)

"Following us?" Xu Ran looked in the direction of Star’s gaze, "Did you find anything?"

"Xi Lu~" (No.)

Star shook its head slightly, uncertain if there really was something trailing them.

Because the presence was very faint.

If it weren’t for its Light Attribute, which clashed with its own, it wouldn’t have noticed it at all.

"Well then, let’s not worry about it for now," Xu Ran laughed it off, shaking his head, "It’s probably just some overconfident little fellow planning to ambush us."

Hearing that, the five little ones dismissively shook their heads and moved on.

A few dozen meters behind the man and five beasts, a tiny figure trembled desperately behind a tree trunk, its large eyes filled with fear.

That was close... almost got caught!
