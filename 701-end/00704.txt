Chapter 709 - 339: The Tricky Organizers And The Flawless Boss Xu_4

He turned his head toward the Cloud Stepping Fox, grinning as he spoke,

"It would be a waste not to eat the food that’s been prepared. Why don’t you eat it?"

"Ying~" (Waste... wasting food is shameful, just this once!)

The Cloud Stepping Fox picked up the food bowl with a conflicted expression and carefully took a bite.

With just one bite, its light blue eyes turned into heart shapes, completely captivated by the delicious taste of the food.

Already starving, it stopped pretending and began to gobble up the food greedily.

Xu Ran stood with his arms crossed, a broad smile on his face.

Dieting? It won’t lose a bit!

-----------------

[Two thousand more words to go, burning the midnight oil]

"Bewitched... bewitched by the taste?"

-----------------

The event organizers were dumbfounded, while on the other side at Starfire Foster Care Shop, Xu Ran encountered a new problem.

"You don’t want to eat?"

He looked at the Cloud Stepping Fox in front of him and couldn’t help but frown.

This Cloud Stepping Fox’s body shape was already on the thin side compared to normal Pet Beasts; it should eat more to fill out.

Unexpectedly, the Cloud Stepping Fox refused to cooperate.

"Ying~" (I’m too fat, I need to diet!)

The Cloud Stepping Fox seriously made its case, its expression very determined.

Food, it wouldn’t eat a bite!

Xu Ran fell silent for a moment, glancing at the Pleasure Value earnings prompt.

Initially, the Cloud Stepping Fox contributed 5 points of Pleasure Value per session, but now it had dropped to 3 points.

This meant that the Cloud Stepping Fox’s foster experience was beginning to deteriorate.

This decline was not because the Cloud Stepping Fox was dissatisfied with its living area, but rather because it was not in a good state at the moment.

In short, hunger affected its mood.

In such a situation, the Cloud Stepping Fox still insisted on not eating a bite of food, which instantly made Xu Ran feel somewhat challenged.

Having hosted many Pet Beast fosters, this truly was the first time he encountered such a situation. Even Pet Beasts were starting to have body image anxieties these days?!

Wait a second... body image anxiety...

A thoughtful look crossed Xu Ran’s face.

He recalled some short video content he had seen in his previous life.

Looking at the Cloud Stepping Fox in front of him, steadfastly refusing to eat, Xu Ran steeled his resolve.

Let’s give it a try, it might just work.

"Wait a moment," Xu Ran said and quickly turned around to leave.

"Ying~" (No matter what you do, I absolutely will not eat!)

Watching Xu Ran’s retreating back, the Cloud Stepping Fox yelled out.

Only when Xu Ran’s figure disappeared did it lift a paw and rub its completely empty stomach.

So hungry...

But it must endure!

A resolute light shone in the eyes of the Cloud Stepping Fox.

It wanted to become slimmer, more attractive!

Minutes and seconds passed; soon enough, Xu Ran returned.

He was pushing a dining cart, and beside him, along with Shi’Er, followed another Pet Beast.

It was a Lingli Beast.

It was also one of the twenty Pet Beasts involved in this evaluation.

Seeing the Cloud Stepping Fox’s living area for the first time, the Lingli Beast looked around curiously but occasionally glanced at Xu Ran’s dining cart.

The faint scent drifting from the cart made it swallow its saliva involuntarily.

Seeing Xu Ran approaching, the Cloud Stepping Fox’s eyes filled with extra vigilance.

"Mew~" (What are you going to do?)

"It’s almost noon, time for lunch." Xu Ran chuckled, sat down on the space in front of the Cloud Stepping Fox, and magically produced a food basin from the food trolley.

The Cloud Stepping Fox’s eyes widened, about to say "I don’t eat that," but realized the food wasn’t prepared for it.

This food basin was placed in front of the Lingli Beast.

The rich aroma spread throughout the area as the lid of the food basin was opened.

Smelling that exotic robust fragrance, the Cloud Stepping Fox couldn’t help but swallow its saliva.

Already hungry, it felt as if a mischievous sprite had awoken its cravings, making it nearly lose its sanity due to starvation.

On the other side, the Lingli Beast was having an even harder time.

Its keen sense of smell had detected the unusual aroma from the food trolley; now that the cover was opened, and the food basin was put before it, the fragrance almost intensified a hundredfold.

Equally hungry, it didn’t hesitate for a second, grabbed a handful, and stuffed it into its mouth, slightly chewed, and then swallowed, savoring the wonderful taste lingering on its tongue, its eyes full of surprise.@@novelbin@@

"Squawk!" (So delicious!)

With a loud cry, the Lingli Beast’s eating pace suddenly quickened, with juices from the food smeared all over its paws and face, but somehow making it even more appetizing.

Watching the Lingli Beast’s performance, Xu Ran smiled with satisfaction.

Choosing it, there were many reasons.

First, the Lingli Beast and the Cloud Stepping Fox were two pet beasts with similar habits, coexisting harmoniously. Although these two did not recognize each other, the Cloud Stepping Fox didn’t mind the Lingli Beast entering its territory.

Next, the dietary habits of the Lingli Beast and Cloud Stepping Fox were also very similar, meaning that the food preferred by the Lingli Beast was likely to be enjoyed by the Cloud Stepping Fox as well.

Lastly, and most importantly, was the ravenous manner in which the Lingli Beast ate.

Seeing the Cloud Stepping Fox staring at the Lingli Beast with widened eyes and continuously swallowing saliva, Xu Ran chuckled quietly to himself.

I’ll show you the power of a mukbang.

No, this is far more impressive than a mukbang.

After all, you can’t smell the food in a mukbang.

And this was not all Xu Ran had prepared.

He leisurely took out another food basin from the food trolley and handed it to Twelve.

Next, it was Twelve’s time to perform.

Twelve pretended to taste a bite of the food from the basin and then curiously asked.

"Chirp?" (Why is today’s food chilled?)

"Chilled food has no calories," Xu Ran said with a mysterious smile, "No calories, no weight gain."

"Chirp!" (I see!)

Twelve made an expression of sudden enlightenment, took a few bites, then picked up a piece of evenly fatty and lean meat.

"Chirp?" (Will eating this not make me fat either?)

"That’s fried meat," Xu Ran said with a smile, "All the calories have been fried out, zero carbs, eat without worry."

"Chirp!" (Alright!)

Twelve slowly savored the food in the basin, occasionally picking out an ingredient and asking about it, and Xu Ran responded fluidly, always proving with various phrases that the food won’t cause weight gain.

The Cloud Stepping Fox’s ears had perked up at some point, watching the Lingli Beast’s mukbang while listening to the exchanges between Xu Ran and Twelve echoing in its ears, feeling the hunger in its body, its expression becoming increasingly rich.

"Squawk!" (I’ve finished!)

Soon, the food basin in front of the Lingli Beast was empty, licked clean without a drop of soup left, while Twelve’s food basin was also empty.

It wasn’t really time for its meal; this was an extra, so the portion wasn’t big.

"Meal’s done, time for us to go," Xu Ran said pretentiously as he started to pack up the food trolley, then, to his surprise, he produced another food basin, "Huh? There’s one left?"

He turned his head toward the Cloud Stepping Fox and said with a smile, "It’d be a waste not to eat the food that’s been made. Why don’t you eat it?"

"Mew~" (It’s... it’s shameful to waste food, just this once!)

The Cloud Stepping Fox took the food basin with a conflicted expression, cautiously tasted a bite.

With just one bite, its pale blue eyes turned into hearts, utterly conquered by the wonderful taste of the food.

Hunger already gnawing at its stomach, it dropped its facade and soon gobbled down the food.

Xu Ran crossed his arms and smiled broadly.

Dieting? There’s no losing a single pound!
