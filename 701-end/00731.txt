Chapter 736 - 348: He Was Defeated By The Power Of Money!_4

Like a wildfire, the already tense atmosphere, compounded by the sudden chaotic battle, completely unleashed the restlessness of the Pet Beasts.

Even the General Stage and King Stage Pet Beasts couldn’t help but join the fight.

Although the hidden organizers, the Beast Masters, reacted immediately and controlled their own Pet Beasts, calling a halt to the battle, how terrifying was the momentum of a King Stage Pet Beast’s full-force effort?

The entire Foster area was shattered, completely rendered uninhabitable.

Fortunately, they were lucid when they lashed out, and no casualties occurred.

Faced with such an unexpected incident, the organizers were devastated.

The Beast Masters showed up immediately, took away their Pet Beasts, announced the premature end of Yang Guang Pet Boarding’s Foster Care experience, and promised that the cost of rebuilding the Foster area would be compensated by the organizers.

While sending off the twenty Pet Beast judges, the owner of Yang Guang Pet Boarding cried like a two-hundred-pound fool, constantly muttering that he would never participate in a Foster Care exhibition again.

Too horrifying!

"Boss! Something bad happened at Yang Guang Pet Boarding!"

Inside Mad Wolf Foster Shop, an employee known for being well-informed rushed to Zou Cheng, gasping due to the fast run.

"What happened to Yang Guang Pet Boarding?" Zou Cheng asked calmly, his expression numb, almost indifferent to ridicule.

"They…" The employee took a deep breath and quickly continued, "Their Foster area has collapsed!"

Zou Cheng: "???"

He turned his head to look at the employee, his face full of disbelief, "Collapsed?"

"Did Yang Guang Pet Boarding provoke some big shot? Was their place smashed up?"

"No…" The employee grimaced as if constipated, "It was destroyed by the fostered Pet Beasts."

Zou Cheng: "…"

For a moment, he really didn’t know what to say.@@novelbin@@

Foster Shops in a Second Level Town generally have the qualification and strength for King Stage Foster Care.

This qualification not only requires that the food provided must meet the daily intake of a King Stage, and the space provided must accommodate their regular activities, but there is also a requirement for robustness, to ensure that it won’t be damaged through regular activities of a King Stage Pet Beast.

Pet Beasts will inevitably show some of their power and release some energy during their daily activities.

If the Foster environment is as frail as paper, it certainly cannot house Pet Beasts with great strength. This has nothing to do with the size of the space, but with its durability.

And the requirements for sparring facilities are even higher than those for Foster areas.

To qualify for King Stage sparring, one must provide an arena that’s nearly impossible to destroy even when a King Stage exerts full force.

The power unleashed during full-force efforts and that during regular activities are not on the same level.

Under normal circumstances, Foster Shops with the means would upgrade their Foster environment to the same level of durability as their sparring facilities to avoid accidental damage.

But Yang Guang Pet Boarding belonged to those without these means.

Their Foster service is up to the King Stage, but sparring only goes up to the General Level.

Therefore, their Foster environment could not withstand a King Stage exerting full force.

Under normal circumstances, a King Stage Pet Beast would not randomly strike in a Foster area. It had been like this at Yang Guang for the past ten years with not a single accident happening.

But the current situation was clearly exceptional.

The King Stage had made a move, and the environment of Yang Guang Pet Boarding couldn’t bear it.

So, Yang Guang was wrecked.

"How could Pet Beasts just up and destroy the Foster environment?" Zou Cheng couldn’t dwell on the setback he faced at Starfire Foster Care Shop and couldn’t help but ask.

"Because…" The employee glanced at Zou Cheng, hesitating.

"If you don’t speak properly right now, I’ll dock half your salary this month!" Zou Cheng snapped angrily.

"Alright, alright, I’ll tell you!" the employee said, clutching his wallet and on the verge of tears, hurrying to speak up, "Because the twenty pet beast judges were in a terrible mood, and then the fight between the two Elite Stage pet beasts became the spark that set off a melee..."

"The reason why the twenty pet beast judges were in such a bad mood..." The employee stole a glance at Zou Cheng, "is because the foster environment is getting worse day by day."

Zou Cheng fell silent.

The foster environment at Yang Guang was far worse than that of Mad Wolf, so it made sense that the mood of the twenty pet beast judges was poor.

But... he mentioned it was getting worse with each passing day.

Not only was Yang Guang worse than Mad Wolf, but also Mad Wolf was inferior to Starfire...

Once dead memories surged again, and thinking of the repeated blows he suffered at Starfire Foster Care Shop, Zou Cheng clutched his chest, slumped back in the chair, his eyes vacant, and with a twisted mouth, he let out a "hehehe" sound.

Seeing Zou Cheng’s state, the employee was startled.

He cautiously stepped forward and couldn’t help but ask, "Boss, are you... alright?"

"I’m fine," Zou Cheng suddenly sat up, a ferocious light in his eyes.

"They! All! Must! Die!"

-----------------

The incident at Yang Guang Pet Boarding spread quickly through the entire foster industry due to its sensational nature, even showing signs of reaching beyond the industry.

The foster shops scheduled to exhibit after Yang Guang Pet Boarding became restless.

This was the first time in many Pet Beast Foster Experience Exhibitions that pet beast judges had gone so far as to destroy the foster area.

Although this was also related to the insufficient strength of Yang Guang Pet Boarding’s own foster area.

But it was still outrageous!

If it happened to them during their turn, with these pet beast judges pulling the same stunt...

The owners of the foster shops lined up behind became increasingly frightened.

Because these pet beast judges had already fought once.

They had made enemies of each other, and even if they shook hands and made peace at the Beast Master’s request, deep down they might not truly forgive each other.

With this in mind, the possibility of a repeat melee at each subsequent foster shop would be higher.

The urgent task was to find out why they fought in the first place!

One by one, the foster shop owners activated their networks, inquiring left and right, and eventually came to an unbelievable conclusion.

The instigator turned out to be a newly opened foster shop.

Because it was newly opened, this shop was scheduled first in the Foster Experience Exhibition.

But this shop handed in a perfect report card, leaving all the pet beast judges extremely satisfied.

Consequently, all subsequent foster shops failed to satisfy the pet beast judges anymore, as if having savored delicacies, they found ordinary food unpalatable. Stay connected via empire

Mad Wolf Foster Shop was the first to fall, with the pet beast judges leaving with darkened faces.

Yang Guang Pet Boarding outdid them by getting their shop smashed up by the pet beast judges.

After hearing this news, all the foster shop owners made the same decision unanimously.

To visit Starfire Foster Care Shop!

They wanted to see for themselves what kind of magic this shop possessed!

On that day, Xu Ran felt quite puzzled.

Because he had received visits from more than a dozen peers in succession, each one requesting to see the foster environment of Starfire Foster.

These colleagues arrived with various expressions and left without a word, their faces bewildered, and those unaware might think Xu Ran was engaged in some shady dealings.

And the organizers of the Pet Beast Foster Experience Exhibition, on that very night, received no less than eleven applications to withdraw from the event.

They were bowing out!
