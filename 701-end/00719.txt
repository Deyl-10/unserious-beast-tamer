Chapter 724 - 345: The Might Of The Poison Fire Bear, Silent Abyss_4

```

"No need," Xu Ran smiled, "Now that you’ve grown in size, it’s time for you to learn Reduction."

"Once your Reduction skill reaches Three Stars, it can fuse with the Burning Soul Body, which would be perfect."

"From the previous allocation of resources, you’ve still got some Value Points to spare, enough to exchange for a One Star skill easily."

At the sound of Xu Ran’s arrangement, the light in Firefly’s eyes sparked to life.

"Luhou!" (I want to learn!)

Xu Ran smiled and nodded, casually exchanging 10 Skill Fragments for the One Star Reduction skill and taught it to Firefly.

Quickly mastering the skill, Firefly’s form wobbled for a moment, then, under the gaze of its companions, rapidly shrank from a height of about three meters down to around one meter.

Though still looking slightly larger than before, it now fit comfortably on Star’s back.

"Jiu?" (Am I the only one without Reduction now?)

Seeing Xu Ran lift Firefly up, Twelve’s expression turned a little quirky.

Ziyun, Star, and Cancan all possessed upgraded and fused Reduction skills. Twelve had thought it would have Firefly for company, but now that Firefly had learned Reduction too, it was the only one left unable to change its Body type.

Damn it!

"You don’t need it for now," Xu Ran reached over to his shoulder and stroked Twelve’s head, "Besides, your Talent Skills don’t have a good fit with Reduction."

"This means that integrating Reduction with your Talent Skills would be difficult."

"Jiu~" (Okay then~)@@novelbin@@

Twelve nodded its head helplessly.

It understood the skill wasn’t really effective for it, but it still felt a little gloomy being the only one without it.

"Let’s go!"

With Firefly’s size issue resolved, Xu Ran called out as he raised his arm, and Star charged forth with a clatter of hooves, racing away from Poison Flame Valley.

-----------------

The Silent Abyss was located about two hundred kilometers south of Poison Flame Valley.

The abyss was constantly shrouded in a dark, profound mist, impervious to any attempt to peer into its depths, even at noon when the sun was at its strongest.

This mist even had the miraculous effect of swallowing sound.

All movements within the abyss failed to penetrate the enveloping fog.

This only added to the Silent Abyss’s mystery.

Within Beast Field number 47, there were countless extraordinary terrains formed for various reasons, and the range covered by the Silent Abyss was so vast that it ranked among the top even among such terrains.

In comparison, Poison Flame Valley was just a little brother.

Such an expansive and extraordinary terrain was, of course, dangerous.

In the adventurer’s guide provided by Xieyun City, this area was marked as extremely hazardous, with even a King Level Beast Master facing a slim chance of survival within it.

Furthermore, unlike other locations, there was no clear indication of how many Beast King Level creatures existed within the Silent Abyss.

Because Xieyun City had also been unable to fully explore this aspect.

And today, the Silent Abyss was welcoming a new visitor.

"Let’s stop here."

Xu Ran said softly, signalling Star to halt, then dismounted and carefully walked towards the edge of the abyss.

The sides of the Silent Abyss were of equal height, with the widest part spanning over a hundred meters, while the narrowest parts were only about ten or so meters across, as if the earth had been abruptly split open.

But no matter its width, the view into the abyss was utterly obscured by the deep dark fog, leaving no detail visible.

Xu Ran’s steps paused at the brink of the abyss, the black mist at his feet swirling, a mere hand’s breadth away from touch.

"Xi Lu~" (There’s a strong Dark Power down there.)

Star, following behind Xu Ran, spoke slowly.

-----------------

[1000 more words to go, working hard to burst the liver]

More importantly, it lacked Reduction.

```

Firefly scratched his head, also realizing the problem, and showed a troubled look on his face.

"Luhou?" (How about I wait here, and you summon me when you arrive?)

"No need," Xu Ran smiled, "Now that your body type has grown larger, it’s time for you to learn Reduction too."

"Once Reduction is upgraded to Three Stars, it can merge with the Burning Soul Body, which will be just right."

"You still have some Value Points left over from the previous resource allocation, enough to exchange for a One Star skill with ease."

Hearing Xu Ran’s arrangements, Firefly’s eyes lit up instantly.

"Luhou!" (I want to learn!)

Xu Ran smiled and nodded, casually exchanging 10 Skill Fragments for the One Star Reduction skill and taught it to Firefly.

Firefly, who quickly grasped the skill, trembled slightly and then quickly shrank under the watchful eyes of his friends, from a height of about three meters to around one meter.

Although he still appeared larger than before, sitting on Star’s back was now more than enough.

"Jiu?" (Am I the only one without Reduction now?)

Watching Xu Ran lift Firefly up, Twelve’s expression became a bit more peculiar.

Ziyun, Star, and Cancan all possessed upgraded Reduction skills that had fused, and originally Twelve had thought he would have Firefly to keep him company, but now even Firefly had acquired Reduction, leaving him the only one unable to change his body type.

Damn it!

"You don’t need it for now," Xu Ran reached to his shoulder and petted Twelve’s head, "Besides, your Talent Skills are not compatible with Reduction."

"That means it would be difficult for you to integrate Reduction into your Talent Skills."

"Jiu~" (Alright~)

Twelve nodded helplessly.

It was aware that this skill wasn’t much use to itself, but it was still a little disheartened that everyone else had it except for it.

"Let’s go!"

Having resolved Firefly’s body size issue, Xu Ran called out energetically, and Star lifted its hooves, transformed into a shadow, and rushed towards the direction away from Poison Flame Valley.

-----------------

The Silent Abyss, located about two hundred kilometers south of Poison Flame Valley.

At all times, the abyss is engulfed in a dark and profound mist, and not even at the brightest moment of noon can one catch a glimpse of anything within the abyss.

And this fog also has the magical effect of swallowing up sounds.

All motions inside the abyss fail to spread through the fog.

This makes the Silent Abyss seem even more mysterious.

In the Beast Field No. 47, there are countless superordinary terrains formed for various reasons, and amongst them, the area shrouded by the Silent Abyss is so vast that it ranks near the top even among these extraordinary landscapes.

Compared to it, the Poison Flame Valley is just a little brother.

Such immense superordinary terrain naturally also harbors dangers.

In the adventurer’s guide issued by Xieyun City, this region is marked as extremely dangerous, with even a King Level Beast Master facing a slim chance of survival upon entering.

And unlike other places, the Silent Abyss is not clearly marked with the number of Beast King Level creatures present.

Because even Xieyun City cannot fully ascertain this fact.

And today, the Silent Abyss welcomed a new visitor.

"Let’s stop here," Xu Ran spoke softly, signaling Star to halt, then dismounted and cautiously walked towards the edge of the abyss.

The sides of the Silent Abyss were of the same height, the widest part being hundreds of meters across, while the narrowest part was merely over a dozen meters wide, as if the earth had been abruptly cleaved open.

But no matter the width, the scene inside the abyss was completely obscured by the deep dark fog, not allowing a single detail to be seen.

Xu Ran’s steps came to a halt at the edge, the black mist swirling at his feet, within easy reach with just an outstretched hand.

"Xi Lu~" (There’s a strong concentration of Dark Power below.)

Star followed behind Xu Ran, speaking slowly.
