Chapter 744 - 351 Incoming Call From Xieyun City_2

```

When necessary, Twelve could imprint his soul seal on the target he wished to control. The soul seal contained a part of Twelve’s own consciousness, allowing him to share vision with the target directly and manipulate it from greater distances.

Previously, if Twelve wanted to share vision with a controlled target, he had to rely on the power of the tides of the heart while controlling. Now, he could achieve the same effect without them.

However, this was just the first skill effect of soul imprinting. The second newly added skill effect was even more twisted.

Besides using the controlled creature’s own skills and abilities, a target under the control of a soul imprint could also use all of Twelve’s skills, excluding the soul imprint itself.

When the controlled targets used Twelve’s skills, they relied on the super ability attribute power and skill imprint contained within the soul seal, so each use of Twelve’s own skills would accelerate the breaking and dissipation of the soul seal.

Although this limitation existed, the second effect of the soul imprint meant that Twelve would have dozens of avatars that could act simultaneously.

For Twelve at this moment, it could be said to be an epic level enhancement.

All his other skills are at three stars right now, but when all of these skills break through to four stars… just the thought of it is exciting.

"The effect of this skill is really good." After listening to Twelve’s introduction, Xu Ran’s face also showed a surprised expression.

The fourth skill he chose was indeed a clone-type skill, but to have such a powerful effect after merging, the Interwoven Virtuality and Reality technique was indispensable.

Just by pondering it briefly, he had already realized the terrifying potential of this skill.

Imagine, if fifty controlled targets used Endless Sleep in succession…

Not to mention King Stage, even Overlord stage creatures would probably struggle to withstand such continuous, strong control, right?

Once Cancan and Twelve each enhanced one of their four-star skills, they immediately began distributing other resources.

Cancan currently had only two skills upgraded to Violent Sun Level, and Twelve hadn’t upgraded any. They keenly needed skill points to help increase their skill proficiency.

The available skill points were split evenly between the two little ones, and even then, they felt it was too little and were left wanting more.

After exchanging for the most important skill points, the two little ones’ distribution came to a conclusion.

It was Firefly’s turn.

"Loo hoo!" (I exchange all for physical points!)

Considering the plummeting prices of physical points and as the only one who had not yet reached General stage, Firefly naturally wanted to promptly raise his Growth stage.

Unable to catch up with his four seniors in other aspects for the time being, he decided to first reach a completed General level!

With one breath, he exchanged nearly three hundred thousand physical points, almost emptying the stock, and under everyone’s watchful eyes, Firefly daringly broke through the General stage, instantly surpassing Twelve in growth stage progress.

With this, the resource distribution was thoroughly concluded.

As soon as Xu Ran put away the small blackboard and chalk, there was a gentle knock on the door.

It was the manager of Xuanxing City’s shop, who had just been promoted not long ago.

After receiving Xu Ran’s response, the manager entered the room.

"Boss, the manager of the Xieyun City Fishing Old Man’s shop has called."

-----------------

Xieyun City, Starfire Foster Care Shop.

Xu Ran appeared abruptly in a compartment inside the shop, and after a six-pointed star array flickered, he summoned the five little ones over.

When he pushed open the door of the compartment and walked out, the Fishing Old Man, who had been waiting outside, quickly approached him.

"Boss, Chairman Fang said to find him at the Beast Master Association once you arrive."

"Okay," Xu Ran nodded, his face showing a hint of anticipation.

```

The call from the Fishing Store Manager was because Chairman Fang had come to see him.

According to their previous agreement, if nothing unexpected happened, this visit from Chairman Fang should be about the Mysterious Light Channel.

"You go ahead with your work, I’ll head over now," Xu Ran waved his hand to the Fishing Old Man and strode out of the shop.

Immediately after, his expression subtly shifted.

Observing the long line of customers outside the shop, Xu Ran keenly sensed something different about Xieyun City compared to usual.

The exchange battles had clearly ended, yet the proportion of out-of-towners among the queue seemed even higher than during the exchange battles?

He did not elaborate on his suspicion and kept it to himself, leaping onto Star’s back and swiftly heading towards the direction of the Beast Master Association in Xieyun City.@@novelbin@@

En route, the more he saw foreigners, the deeper Xu Ran’s suspicions became.

What had happened in the short span of days since the end of the exchange battles?

And that question was answered upon reaching the Beast Master Association and meeting Fang Canghai.

"It seems you’ve noticed the changes in Xieyun City too." After hearing Xu Ran’s concerns, Fang Canghai chuckled and pushed a cup of tea towards Xu Ran, "Try this, Zhou Tian City’s corn tea, light yet rich."

"Thank you." Xu Ran accepted and took a sip, feeling as though the impatience from his hurried journey was smoothed away instantly.

Having a sip of the tea himself, Fang Canghai slowly began, "These past few days, Xieyun City has indeed undergone significant changes."

"It’s not just Xieyun City; more than half of the 3rd Level towns and Second Level towns within Beast Field 47, as well as some of the 3rd Level towns inside the Beast King-level Beast Fields nearby, have all experienced drastic changes."

"This shift mainly stems from the migration of the cities’ populations," Fang Canghai explained, tapping the table with his finger, "This is also the first resolution passed after the formation of the Alliance—’Strength from the South, Aid to the North’."

"All city Beast Master Associations in the Alliance, while ensuring the safety of their own city, will send as many high-rank Beast Masters as possible to be stationed in the northern cities."

"Meanwhile, the northern cities’ less capable elderly, women, and children are being moved to the southern cities under the escort of high-rank Beast Masters."

"As for the reason behind this…" Fang Canghai paused for a moment, "it’s because Beast Field 8 is located to the north of Beast Field 47."

"I understand," Xu Ran nodded in realization, his respect for Fang Canghai growing.

Undoubtedly, such population migration would effectively preserve the human fighting force in the face of a potential attack from Beast Field 8, allowing for a swifter counterstrike.

Moreover, the migration between human cities could quickly dissolve any barriers between citizens of different cities, reinforcing the concept of the Alliance in everyone’s heart.

It hasn’t even been ten days since the Alliance was established.

In such a short time, Fang Canghai had not only successfully implemented this resolution but had also shown remarkable execution, already achieving preliminary results.

It was evident that he had been preparing for this for quite some time.

"In a while, the Monster Wood Semi-Saint will relocate the entire Monster Wooden Domain here," Fang Canghai said with a smile, "It will hold the fort in the north and transform the entire Monster Wooden Domain into the stronghold for the upcoming battle."

"Good," Xu Ran nodded slightly.

It had been a while since he last saw the Monster Wood Semi-Saint; he still had the leaf given to him, which he hadn’t had the heart to use.

With the participation of the Monster Wood Semi-Saint, even if the opponent was from Beast Field 8, it seemed less frightening.

After all, the opponent couldn’t directly bring a Saint Rank down to the fight, could they?

Broken Abyss City was not just for show.

"The reason I called you here is for the Mysterious Light Channel," Fang Canghai said, taking another sip of tea and diving into the main topic, "Exploring the Mysterious Light Channel was a key factor for the presidents of other city Beast Master Associations to agree to the alliance."

"Nobody wants to stay weak, and without me leading, they wouldn’t be able to enter," he said.

"And that is exactly what I want to see," Fang Canghai continued slowly, "Calamity is upon us, and the stronger the high-rank Beast Masters become, the more hope we have of victory in the upcoming battle."
