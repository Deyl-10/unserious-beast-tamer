Chapter 794 - 378 Broken Realm Core!_2

```

Hearing that Ji Xuan from Broken Abyss City had slain six Semi-Saints alone, it let out a hearty laugh. Upon learning that Ji Xuan was stationed in the eighth Beast Field and dared not dispatch any Semi-Saints, yet had sent out a large number of Beast Emperors, the Demon Wood Semi-Saint’s combat fervor soared, wishing it could strike immediately.

"Let’s stop here," said Xu Ran, finishing his words. The Demon Wood Semi-Saint slowly opened its mouth. At this moment, its body was large enough to cover the mountain valley it hid in, "If I continue to enhance, movement will become somewhat troublesome."

After speaking, it began to actively compress its massive body until finally, it returned to the three- to four-meter height it had initially.

The extreme compression made every one of its branches and leaves erupt with tremendous Earth attribute Power, and the terrifying aura convinced Xu Ran, who experienced it firsthand, that a casual lash from the Demon Wood Semi-Saint could severely injure an ordinary Beast Emperor.

One of its branches stretched out. Under Xu Ran’s astonished gaze, it grew rapidly, quickly becoming a two-meter-tall treant. Its expression calm and peaceful, it lifted its rooted body from the earth with force, pulling it directly out and carrying it on its shoulder.

Countless scattered roots rapidly converged, transforming into sharp spear blades; the tree trunk became the spear shaft, and numerous leaves detached, turning into mottled patterns on the spear shaft.

Thus, in the hands of the treant, its body had become a long spear.

At this, Xu Ran wasn’t even able to determine which was the true body anymore.

The Demon Wood Semi-Saint swung the long spear in its hand, feeling satisfied with its now conveniently mobile body, and nodded in approval.

"Let’s go."

Xu Ran was dumbfounded.

What kind of a stance was this?!

Seeing Xu Ran’s confusion, the Demon Wood Semi-Saint grinned.

"Having evolved once, I should naturally show some improvement."

"I may no longer be a Semi-Saint, but I’m no longer the ordinary Sky-touching Mysterious Wood either."

Xu Ran nodded.

He had no doubts about that.

Looking at the Demon Wood Semi-Saint’s oppressive presence now, it still retained a semblance of a Semi-Saint’s aura. Even though it lacked the former sky-shrouding oppression, its strength was clearly more pronounced.

"Star."

"Xi Lu!"

Star let out an excited neigh, bearing Xu Ran and the other four little ones back the way they came.

Declining Xu Ran’s invitation to ride together, the treant that was the Demon Wood Semi-Saint followed at a leisurely pace. Star’s speed was already extremely terrifying, but in front of the Demon Wood Semi-Saint, it still didn’t measure up.

Its feet tapped a peculiar rhythm on the ground. With every touch, it sent out layers of earthy yellow ripples, drawing vast Power from the earth. It looked like a leisurely stroll, yet it managed to keep close behind Star without falling behind at all.

Cancan, who was lying on Star’s back, only needed one glance before she was unable to look away.

As a fellow Earth attribute being, she could perceive just how powerful the Demon Wood Semi-Saint’s control over the Earth attribute Power was at that moment.

It was as though the earth itself was part of its body.

Such control of power was something she couldn’t even dream of reaching.

The group quickly passed the Withered Wood Forest they had encountered on the way. The Demon Wood Semi-Saint casually glanced at it and then smiled.

"Was it here that my fallen branch, the one containing a trace of my power, was found?"

"Yes," Xu Ran responded with a nod.

"It seems that it was my fate not to die," the Demon Wood Semi-Saint sighed, "Without that branch retaining a sliver of my power, even with the leaves I left behind, it would have been hard for you to find me immediately."

"Since my life was not destined to end here, I ought to cherish this second life." The expression in the Demon Wood Semi-Saint’s eyes suddenly became sharp.

The being that had stepped down to the Emperor Stage, it seemed to have become a different thing from before.

With their swift pace, the surroundings flew past rapidly like whirling constellations, and soon, Xuanxing City came into view.

Xu Ran initially wanted to have the Demon Wood Semi-Saint stay in Xuanxing City for a moment, but the Demon Wood Semi-Saint stopped.

"I plan to return to the Monster Wooden Domain," the Demon Wood Semi-Saint spoke slowly, "You can inform Fang Canghai and the other city lords of my return."

"But there’s no need to let too many people know about this news."

```

"At this moment, I’m afraid I’m already being overlooked by the Beast Field No. 8, and this neglect is my greatest reliance and advantage. I must continue to exert it."

Xu Ran simply pondered for a moment and then understood what Demon Wood Semi-Saint meant, immediately nodding, "Then, Senior, take great care, I’ll go and inform Senior Fang and the rest about this news."@@novelbin@@

"Go ahead." Demon Wood Semi-Saint watched Xu Ran enter Xuanxing City, then took a deep breath and his figure swiftly vanished from the spot.

O Saints, I shall make a comeback.

"What? You’ve found Demon Wood Semi-Saint and even revived it?!" Hearing Xu Ran’s report, Qi Yuan’s eyes widened.

"Yes." Xu Ran nodded, "However, its power cannot return to the Semi-Saint level."

"It’s more than good enough that it has come back." Qi Yuan waved his hand, "With Demon Wood Semi-Saint still around, the Transcendent Beings within Beast Field No. 47 will have a pillar of support."

"For us, this is already incredibly good news."

Facing external threats, Humans and Transcendent Beings of Beast Field No. 47 set aside their hatred for each other and joined forces for the first time, unexpectedly achieving Demon Wood Semi-Saint’s former goal.

However, the Transcendent Beings did not obey Humans’ commands, nor did they have a pillar of support to stand out, greatly diminishing their strength following the disappearance of Demon Wood Semi-Saint.

Now that Demon Wood Semi-Saint has returned, at least there’s no need to worry about this anymore.

"So now, has Demon Wood Semi-Saint returned to the Monster Wooden Domain?"

"Yes." Xu Ran nodded and conveyed Demon Wood Semi-Saint’s thoughts to Qi Yuan, "Demon Wood Semi-Saint does not want to reveal its revival just yet. Its neglect by Beast Field No. 8 allows it to become the most crucial trump card in this battle."

"Furthermore, it needs more time to strengthen itself."

"I understand." Qi Yuan pondered briefly and realized the advantages of this approach, chuckling and stroking his chin, "I promise, within Xuanxing City, only I will know about this."

"You should go now and report back to Fang Canghai."

"Yes!" Xu Ran nodded and took his leave.

Before long, with the Transmission array of Starfire Foster Care Shop, he had already arrived in Xieyun City.

"What?!" Hearing Xu Ran’s report, Fang Canghai too was astounded, "I only asked you to deliver a message."
