Chapter 723 - 345: The Might Of The Poison Fire Bear, Silent Abyss_3

Immediately after, the firefly grabbed the fierce wolf’s head and hurled it violently, throwing its body towards the stunned pack leader.

Everything happened so fast that the pack leader had yet to react when it was hit full-on by the fierce wolf, whose body was engulfed in flames. The flames swiftly spread from the corpse of the fierce wolf to the pack leader, instantly covering its body.

"Awoo—"

The pack leader let out a terrified and agonizing howl, writhing in pain on the spot under the continuous damage of the Scorching Heart Flame. After rolling around for a few breaths, its movements gradually slowed down, eventually becoming still and silent.

The remaining three fierce wolves watched the scene unfold with wide eyes, fully aware they had encountered a formidable foe. One by one, they tucked their tails and fled in panic, not daring to look back at the carnage behind them.

The firefly couldn’t be bothered to chase after them. It stretched lazily, quite pleased with its recent performance.

To its earlier self, the Leadership Stage was an incredibly powerful level.

Even with three Full Moon Level skills, its chance of defeating a Leadership Stage opponent while being at the Elite Stage was still slim.

And now, three Leadership Stage fierce wolves had been effortlessly taken down by it, a stark contrast to before, providing a clear understanding of its current power.

It had grown stronger!

However, glancing at the four seniors, any pride that had just risen in the firefly instantly vanished.

Well... compared to the four seniors, it still had a long way to go!

"Is this the effect of Scorching Heart Flame?" Xu Ran said, looking at the three bodies still burning on the ground, his face showing a touch of astonishment.

The previous Eternal Burning Flame could indeed cause sustained burning and damage, but it was difficult to take an opponent’s life in such a short span of time.

This indicated that Scorching Heart Flame had a more potent damaging effect than Eternal Burning Flame.

Of course, this was also related to the presence of Fire Poison.

Setting aside the King’s Power skill that all King Species have, the firefly had one last skill to test.

That was the Two stars skill Fire Eating that it had acquired during its evolution.

"How effective is Fire Eating?" Xu Ran asked with curiosity.

On hearing Xu Ran’s question, the firefly chuckled heh heh.

During the recent battle, it had already considered demonstrating the effect of Fire Eating.

This tactic was called forward thinking!

It merely took a light inhale, and the flames raging on the rock walls, the bodies, and the earth seemed to encounter a devouring black hole, involuntarily drifting and flying towards the firefly before being swallowed by it directly.

After completing this action, the presence around the firefly visibly recovered at the speed of sight.

"This skill…" Xu Ran’s eyes gleamed slightly, "can absorb flames to replenish its own power?"

"Luhou!" (Exactly! Any fire will do!)

The firefly nodded vigorously, its eyes filled with a hint of joy.

Although this skill was only two stars, it held great appeal to it.

Xu Ran’s eyes lit up.

The effects of this skill were quite interesting.

Recovery skills weren’t unique to the firefly.

Star and Cancan also possessed recovery skills.

However, their skills fundamentally differed from the firefly’s.

Star and Cancan’s recovery skills accelerated their absorption of the ambient unclaimed elemental power to heal themselves.

The firefly’s Fire Eating, on the other hand, directly consumed flames to restore its power.

The latter had its limitations, requiring flames for recovery, but it also had advantages the former lacked.

That is, it could also be used as a combat skill while serving as a recovery ability.

If it encountered an opponent with Fire Attribute, the firefly could offset the enemy’s advantage by consuming their flames, achieving an effect of mutual demise.

Coupled with its mastery of Fluid Fire Avoidance, a skill providing immunity to fire, the combination solidified the firefly’s invincibility against same-attribute opponents.

Xu Ran could already imagine the scene when the firefly faced an opponent of the same Fire Attribute.

The only downside was that the firefly’s skills were highly specific to the same attribute, losing some advantage when facing other attributes.

It was a trade-off.

However, there was still room for the firefly’s skills to be upgraded to Four Stars; it wouldn’t be able to rely solely on Four Stars Skill Scrolls for improvement. By considering skill fusion during the process, perhaps the firefly’s attribute coverage could be broadened a bit.

If it could cover all attributes…

"The firefly’s evolution has come to a successful conclusion," Xu Ran mused, unable to suppress a laugh, "Let’s leave this place now."

Finding the Heart Burning Poisonous Flame Marrow ahead of time without alerting the dozen or so Beast Kings deep within Poison Flame Valley saved them a lot of trouble.

"Xi Lu~" (Let’s go to the Silent Abyss!)

Star neighed excitedly, stamping its hooves impatiently on the ground.

The firefly’s issue had come to a close, but Star’s own adventure was far from over!@@novelbin@@

"Alright! Let’s go!" Xu Ran swiftly mounted his horse, and as usual, picked up the other Pet Beasts onto Star’s back. But upon seeing the firefly, his face involuntarily showed a trace of amusement.

The firefly used to be small enough to easily fit on Star’s broad back. Now, standing three meters tall, it had reached the category of a Large Pet Beast, making it not so easy to ride on Star’s back.

More importantly, it hadn’t undergone a Reduction.

The firefly scratched its head, realizing the problem as well, its face showing a troubled expression.

"Luhou?" (How about I wait here and you summon me when you get there?)
