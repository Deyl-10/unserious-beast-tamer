Chapter 762 - 361: Blood Sacrifice? Beast Sacrifice!_2

```

"We contribute five more, and you provide the remaining six, how about we split the treasure of this place evenly?"

"How about not." Fang Canghai chuckled, "Pet Beasts are our life-or-death partners, how can we sacrifice them so easily?"

"Pretense, all humans are like this." Another Beast Emperor sneered, "Your so-called contracts are nothing more than enslaving our Beast Race."

"Anyway, we would never send our companions into the array voluntarily." Fang Canghai, uninterested in arguing, spoke calmly, "How about this instead, you fill it with twelve lives, and we will let you have the treasure first."

"Hm?" The Radiant Phoenix’s gaze instantly sharpened upon hearing this.

It had proposed an equal contribution of six lives each, considering that the humans would not let go of the treasure at hand. Since both sides were vying for it, it was natural that not all sacrifices should come from their side, the Transcendent Beings.

But Fang Canghai’s words seemed to imply something else.

The human side didn’t want the treasure here?

There must be a problem!

If the resources here weren’t the issue, then the humans must have some clues unknown to them.

It stared intensely at Fang Canghai, trying to discern something from his eyes.

Fang Canghai met its gaze without wavering, remaining composed.

Taking a deep breath, the Radiant Phoenix’s aura soared skyward like a blinding burst of light, making the entire side hall seem as if it were directly exposed to sunlight. Its fierce aura surged heavenward, rapidly bearing down on Fang Canghai.

"We each contribute six lives, and there will be no concessions on this matter!"

"Tsk..." Fang Canghai’s gaze flickered slightly.

He knew that the others had become suspicious.

After all, before this, their Beast Masters had fought to the death with the Transcendent Beings in the main hall for a few resources, yet now they were readily letting go of the resources.

With a helpless shake of his head, Fang Canghai murmured, "Take action!"

The Beast Masters, already prepared to strike, responded in unison. Their Pet Beasts quickly dispersed, and before the Transcendent Beings could react, they were swiftly toppled towards the array’s direction.

One after another, the Transcendent Beings howled in fury and confusion, struggling to control their bodies to avoid the fatal consequences of falling into the array.

But because the humans were well-prepared, some Transcendent Beings did not react in time; in the next second, they were shattered by the array, turning into a rain of blood.

Witnessing the blood rain and how the array mercilessly devoured it, quickly dimming the nine pillars, the five Beast Emperors flew into a rage in an instant, their Imperial Crowns blasting skyward.

And the other Transcendent Beings also fell into a frenzy, launching a counterattack.

Moments later, an Overlord Level Pet Beast was struck by three Overlord Level Transcendent Beings working together and was sent into the array, dying instantly.

The corresponding Beast Master of the fallen beast grunted, eyes reddening in an instant, grinding teeth and coordinating with his other Pet Beasts in a frenzy of retaliation.

The other Beast Masters also united in their hatred, and before long, one of the previously striking Overlord Level Transcendent Beings was sent into the array.

As the light from all twelve pillars dimmed, the chaos in the arena instantly froze. The Transcendent Beings, who had been closely monitoring the array, ceased their movements, and the humans did the same.

"Go!" Fang Canghai’s roar echoed throughout the hall, taking the lead in leaving his Pet Beast behind and rushing towards the array ahead.

The other Beast Masters followed suit, each charging into the array.

"Want to compete in speed?" One of the Beast Emperors let out a fierce roar, poised to rush into the array, only to be instantly restrained by the Radiant Phoenix.

In the next instant, an Overlord Level that had entered the array was crushed by the array, causing its expression to turn ugly.

As it watched the Beast Tamers enter the array unscathed, it was infuriated, its aura trembling violently.

"Despicable humans!"

Seeing that those Beast Tamers entered the array without bringing their Pet Beasts, it had already sensed something was amiss, and now, seeing this scene, how could it not understand the situation?

The array had indeed been unlocked.

But the only ones who could enter were still humans.

Twelve lives were sacrificed, with humans losing only one Overlord, while their side had fallen eleven Overlords!

"Don’t forget, this place after all, is a human relic." Fang Canghai sneered, raising his hand to shatter the dim shield on the stone pillar before him.

```

Other Beast Masters acted in quick succession, and soon the twelve treasures placed atop the stone pillars were fully revealed.

Xu Ran took a deep breath, his gaze instantly fixed on one of the items.

It was a long saber embedded atop the stone pillar.

Around the saber, natural saber auras wrapped around, slightly distorting the empty space around it. The sharp edge of the blade reflected a cold light, and its bold aura evoked a strong desire in Xu Ran.

He wanted this saber!

Although the broken saber was good, it was no longer sufficient since he acquired the Sky-Cleaving Six Sabers.

As if sensing Xu Ran’s thoughts, Fang Canghai casually made a gesture, and the long saber obediently flew up, heading towards Xu Ran, "Xu Ran, you’re a saber user. This one’s for you."

The other Beast Masters remained silent.

Although Xu Ran was the weakest among them, he was the one who found the secrets of this place twice. In terms of merit, he deserved one of the treasures.

"Thank you!" Xu Ran raised his hand to grasp the hilt, and the long saber suddenly let out a soft cry, as if resentful of being wielded, its radiant saber auras becoming frenzied in an instant, slicing fine bloodlines onto Xu Ran’s body.

Xu Ran’s eyes quickly sharpened, the saber force he had comprehended from the Sky-Cleaving Six Sabers instantly erupted, inch by inch suppressing the surging saber auras back into the saber.

When all the saber auras were forcibly suppressed back into the saber, the saber also gave off a reluctant shiver, gradually calming down.

This one was a typical bully that feared the strong.

In the clash of saber forces just now, Xu Ran had also come to know the name of the saber in his hand.

The saber’s name was Mozhui.

Satisfied, Xu Ran put away Mozhui and looked around.

By this time, the other treasures had also found their new owners.

The Overlord Level Beast Master who lost a Pet Beast in the recent melee took an extra piece as compensation, while the rest chose according to their needs.@@novelbin@@

While the humans were dividing the treasures, the atmosphere outside the array grew increasingly tense.

The Transcendent Beings didn’t act, but they watched the array with covetous eyes.

Clearly, they had no intention of giving up.

But the human side had naturally anticipated the current situation.

"Act, block them," Fang Canghai ordered in a low voice, striding out of the array and walking towards the passageway leading to the next opportunity.

Five Beast Emperors were about to take action when they saw six Emperor Stage Pet Beasts with no intention of leaving, stepping forward to block their path.

The other Beast Masters did the same.

One by one, the Transcendent Beasts were intercepted by their Pet Beasts, and even the five little ones joined forces to block two or three Overlords.

As they watched all the humans enter the next chamber of opportunity, the Radiant Phoenix laughed in rage at the Pet Beasts blocking the way, "This is what you get for cooperating with the humans!"

"Humans are always cunning, no matter the world!"

"They’ve abandoned you, and you’re still so delusional, blocking us for them?!"

The response to the Radiant Phoenix, however, was the Pet Beasts’ looks of pity, as if they were looking at an idiot.

Seeing such a look made the Radiant Phoenix even angrier, "Am I wrong?"

The strongest Pet Beast of Fang Canghai that remained, an azure-colored Azure Dragon, finally couldn’t help speaking out the collective mind of the Pet Beasts, "Ah, yes, yes, yes."

Not waiting for the Radiant Phoenix to continue inciting, the next moment all the Pet Beasts radiated golden light, with the Hexagram Star Array twinkling under their feet.

Before everyone’s eyes, they simply vanished on the spot, leaving behind a group of Transcendent Beings staring in astonishment.

"What’s going on here?" one of the Overlords muttered in confusion after a moment, breaking the silence.

"After them!" The fury in the Radiant Phoenix’s eyes almost turned tangible as it lunged towards the passageway.

They had been played!
