Chapter 739 - 349 Main Task 4 Completed, A-Grade System Skill!_3

At this moment, his mind was preoccupied with a single thought.

Why did he have only one System Skill Upgrade Command?

He wanted all three A-grade skills!

Taking a deep breath, Xu Ran began to compare the differences between the three skills.

The effect of Plucking Fur was undoubtedly the most useful; the chance of obtaining skills from Washing and Protection for three-star and below turned into a guaranteed outcome, and even four-star skills had become attainable.

However, in the entire Beast Field 47, there were only so many Pet Beasts of the Emperor Species, and the Starfire Foster Shop could only accommodate Pet Beasts up to the King Stage, with even fewer qualifying Emperor Species ones.

Counting on obtaining four-star skills through Washing and Protection was not feasible for now.

Not until the system was upgraded to accommodate higher-stage Pet Beasts could the skill’s effect truly come into play, but according to the rewards of main task 5, all skills would have been raised to A-grade by the time the system upgraded.

Therefore, the priority of improving Plucking Fur actually wasn’t high, since the permanent buff it came with was the least among the three skills.@@novelbin@@

After advancing to A-grade, Drug Application would greatly increase the gain of physical points. Currently, the three little ones hardly ever exchanged for physical points anymore, because compared to other resources, the cost-effectiveness of physical points was somewhat low.

If the gain from physical points could be multiplied by several times, Xu Ran might consider reducing their price, exchanging one value point for two or even more physical points.

Besides, the buff that came with A-grade Drug Application was also quite tempting for Xu Ran.

The Pleasure value gained from Foster Care Service, which was between Washing and Protection and accompanying practice, would surpass Washing and Protection and become the most important source of Pleasure value for the Starfire Foster Shop if it could be increased by 50%.

It meant a significant increase in Pleasure value, and with more Pleasure value, the Lottery drawing would also yield more good stuff.

The final A-grade Pranks skill was somewhere between the two previous options.

Skill Points, unlike physical points, played an extremely important role until Pet Beasts reached the Violent Sun Level. Currently, only Ziyun and Star had Pet Beasts with all skills at the Violent Sun Level; the other three little ones still needed them greatly.

The 30% buff to the Pleasure value gain from Pranks was also considerable, but since Pranks itself yielded relatively low Pleasure value, its contribution to Xu Ran’s overall profit was limited.

After weighing the three skills, Xu Ran’s gaze finally settled on Drug Application.

It’s decided then, you’re the one!

[Still 3,000 words to go, crazily cramming]

It was not until the next morning that Xu Ran learned eleven Foster Shops had withdrawn from the Pet Beast Care Experience Exhibition.

Stay updated with empire

He couldn’t remain oblivious because staff from the organizing committee had personally notified each participating Foster Shop.

Moreover, the staff member responsible for informing Xu Ran spoke with a vengeful tone, sharing the entire backstory of the incident with him.

When Xu Ran found out everything had stemmed from Starfire Foster’s too-good-to-be-true Foster Care Service, he couldn’t help but feel a mix of amusement and astonishment; and upon learning that the next Pet Beast Care Experience Exhibition might be canceled as a result, he didn’t know what to say.

It wasn’t really his fault, the competition was just too weak.

After finally sending off the staff member, Liu Fengyun showed up.

"Boss Xu, you’ve really made a name for yourself throughout Xuanxing City this time," Liu Fengyun chuckled, showing no concern even though it was their turn to host the Pet Beast judges today. "To be honest, I didn’t expect such a situation to occur either."

He was familiar with the unique environment of Starfire Foster, but such a bizarre turn of events was beyond even his expectations.

"It’s your Wind and Cloud Foster Shop’s turn today; I hope the Pet Beast judges won’t cause your Foster area to collapse as well," Xu Ran couldn’t resist expressing his concern.

"It won’t come to that," Liu Fengyun waved dismissively, "Our Foster Shop might not be as good as Pingtian’s, but it isn’t so bad that it would provoke the Pet Beast judges into a fight."

"And even if they did fight... our Foster area wouldn’t collapse," Liu Fengyun shrugged, "I’m lying low because there’s no chance of winning first place anyway."

"I mainly came by to congratulate Boss Xu for clinching the championship early and for ending the exhibition prematurely," Liu Fengyun’s face was tinged with playful mockery, clearly having received the same news.

Xu Ran: "…"

At a loss for words, Xu Ran managed to entertain Liu Fengyun and eventually saw him off before officially starting to welcome clients. Just as the previous day, a long line of customers waiting just outside the door streamed in, each asking to tour the Foster area.

This arduous task fell to Twelve.

As time passed, three days flew by.

With the last participating Foster Shops gradually completing their reception of the Pet Beast judges, the Pet Beast Care Experience Exhibition ended abruptly amidst chaos.

The organizing committee announced the final experience scores, and Starfire Foster Shop won first place with a perfect score. Pingtian Foster Shop fell to second place for the first time, scoring much lower than previous years at only 76 points.

To the surprise of many, Mad Wolf Foster Shop took third place.

The early end to the exhibition, eleven days before its scheduled conclusion, left countless Beast Tamers in Xuanxing City brimming with curiosity, eager to uncover the specifics.

Soon after, they were hit with a late yet shocking revelation.

The Starfire Foster Shop, which could make other Foster Shops withdraw one by one with its unrivaled Foster Care Service, instantly became known to an untold number of people.

The line of customers outside the shop, already bursting at the seams, grew even longer.

In this quiet and unassuming way, the Fame of Starfire Foster Shop broke through 50%.

On the evening of receiving the first-place medal, with business over for the day, Xu Ran was greeted by a line of text.
