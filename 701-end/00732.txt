Chapter 737 - 349 Main Task 4 Completed, A-Grade System Skill!

In the Beast Master Association meeting room of Xuanxing City, the organizers of the foster care experience exhibition convened.

The usually cheerful and noisy meeting room was now more somber than the gloomy skies outside the window.

The twenty pet beast evaluators first deeply self-reflected on their oversight before silently gazing at the stack of eleven applications on the table in the middle of the room.

"Let’s discuss it, how should we handle this?" one of the king-level main evaluators slowly started, with a serious expression, "These foster shops resolutely refuse to participate in the foster care experience exhibition."

"Let’s just skip them according to the byes and move on," a judge couldn’t help but say, "by order, it should be Wind and Cloud Foster Shop’s turn tomorrow."

"This isn’t about the order..." another judge rubbed his brow, "Out of seventeen participating shops, more than half are dropping out, won’t the final scoring look like a joke when announced?"

"What worries me is not that," another judge pondered for a moment before speaking slowly, "I’m concerned about the next pet beast foster care experience exhibition."

The meeting room once again fell into silence.

In previous foster care experience exhibitions, although Pingtian Foster Shop always secured the first place, the gap between it and the other foster shops wasn’t big—it was a gap that could be closed.

At least, this year, Mad Wolf Foster Shop almost caught up with Pingtian Foster Shop.

Thus, there was still motivation for the other foster shops to participate.

But if a foster shop like Starfire Foster appears in the exhibition, dwarfing other shops so much that they see no hope of catching up, the circumstances will definitely change.

One could tell from the stubborn owner of Yang Guang Pet Boarding crying and saying he’ll never participate again.

One can imagine that if Starfire Foster Shop takes part in the next pet beast foster care experience exhibition, the likelihood of other shops signing up would significantly decrease.

If the vast Xuanxing City ends up with only a few, or perhaps only two or three, foster shops participating, the very purpose of the pet beast foster care experience exhibition would be completely lost.

Your next journey awaits at empire

And the possibility of excluding Starfire Foster Shop is even more inconceivable.

Without a doubt, after this pet beast foster care experience exhibition, Starfire Foster Shop’s fame is set to skyrocket, with a high chance of it becoming the number one foster shop in Xuanxing City.

An exhibition without such a foster shop would also turn into a joke.

"This pet beast foster care exhibition will finish after comparing the last three participating foster shops, and we will then announce the final scores," the four main evaluators decided after discussion, "As for the next one... we will decide whether to hold it based on the registration situation at that time."

The evaluators remained silent.

Does that mean, if by that time no foster shop signs up, the pet beast foster care experience exhibition won’t be held anymore?@@novelbin@@

A judge couldn’t help but let out a deep sigh.

"This is really killing the exhibition..."

-----------------

It wasn’t until the following morning that Xu Ran learned about the withdrawal of eleven foster shops from the pet beast foster care experience exhibition.

He had no choice but to be informed, as the organizers had sent staff to notify every participating foster shop.

Furthermore, the staff member responsible for notifying Xu Ran relayed the whole situation to him in a tone brimming with resentment.

When Xu Ran found out that everything stemmed from Starfire Foster’s service being too good, he was naturally caught between laughter and tears, and when he learned that the next pet beast foster care experience exhibition might not be held because of this, he was at a loss for words.

However, he couldn’t be blamed for this, as the competition was simply too weak.

After finally sending off the staff, Liu Fengyun showed up.

"Boss Xu, you’ve really made a name for yourself throughout Xuanxing City this time." Liu Fengyun chuckled, not at all worried about their turn hosting the pet beast evaluators that day, "Honestly, I didn’t expect things to turn out this way either."

He was no stranger to Starfire Foster Shop’s unique foster environment, but even he hadn’t anticipated such an unexpected development.

"Today it’s your Wind Cloud Foster Shop’s turn; I hope those pet beast judges don’t tear your foster area apart," Xu Ran couldn’t help but express his concern.

"It won’t happen," Liu Fengyun waved his hand dismissively, "Our foster shop might not compare to Pingtian, but we’re not so bad that evaluators would come to blows over it."

"And even if they did come to blows, our foster area won’t be destroyed," Liu Fengyun shrugged, "I’ve already resigned myself to not getting first place anyway."

"My main reason for coming is to congratulate Boss Xu on securing the championship ahead of time and inadvertently killing the exhibition," Liu Fengyun’s face took on a mocking expression, showing that he too had received the news.

Xu Ran: "..."

He didn’t know what to say at the moment.

After entertaining Liu Fengyun for a while and seeing him off, Xu Ran officially started receiving customers. Just like the day before, a long queue formed outside the door, and every customer who entered requested to tour the foster area.

This challenging task was entrusted to Twelve.

Time flew, and three days passed.

As the final three participating foster shops completed their receptions of the pet beast judges, this edition of the pet beast foster care experience exhibition came to an abrupt end amid a flurry of commotion.

The organizers released the final experience scores, and Starfire Foster Shop won first place with a perfect score, while Pingtian Foster Shop, for the first time, took second place with a much lower score than in previous years, scoring only 76 points.

To the surprise of many, Mad Wolf Foster Shop took third place.

The early end to the exhibition left numerous Beast Tamers in Xuanxing City brimming with curiosity, eager to investigate the exact details.
