Chapter 742 - 350 Talent Skill Fusion!_2

Fusion failure was within Xu Ran’s expectations. His eyes were fixed on the increased probability of success after failure, and soon a look of surprise appeared on his face.

After so many fusion attempts, Xu Ran had become very familiar with the increase in success rate that each failure added to the Skill Fusion Stone.

One could say that before the start of a skill fusion, he could predict the success rate after a potential failure, and his estimates were very accurate.

Thus, he immediately realized that the Talent Skill Fusion Stones increased the success rate by a much larger margin than the ordinary Skill Fusion Stones when a fusion failed!

This meant that when the likelihood of fusion success was close, using Talent Skill Fusion Stones would significantly reduce the number of fusion stones needed to succeed!

Continue!

Having tried once, Xu Ran was now certain that the thirty-four Talent Skill Fusion Stones he held were enough to help Ziyun fuse at least one new skill.

His consumption of Talent Skill Fusion Stones grew faster and faster until the words "Fusion success" appeared before his eyes, prompting him to skillfully halt his actions.

Twenty-six stones.

With just twenty-six Talent Skill Fusion Stones, Xu Ran completed a skill fusion with a success rate of less than one in a thousand.

He exhaled a breath of turbid air and immediately turned to Ziyun’s panel.

The Immortal Body and Thunder Punishment skills both dimmed and disappeared, replaced by a brand-new skill.

Success!

Xu Ran’s heart surged with excitement. As he looked closely, he soon discovered what made this Skill Fusion different from previous ones.

In previous skill fusions, if a higher star level was not reached, the skill would maintain its original star rating.

For example, the fusion of two Two Star Skills would form a stronger Two Star Skill, but it would still be Two Stars.

But now, the fusion of two Four Star Talent Skills had resulted in a new skill with a Five Star rating, even though one of the stars was hollow, indicating that it was not a true Five Star Skill.

Such a skill might more aptly be described as a quasi-Five Star Skill.

With this in mind, Xu Ran turned to Ziyun and a look of surprise appeared on his face, "Ziyun, why have you turned black?"

"Meow?" (I’ve turned black?)

Ziyun blinked, a look of bemusement on its face. Read new chapters at empire

With the successful fusion of the two Talent Skills, it felt as if the corresponding skill memories had been erased, replaced by countless depictions of the new skill in use.

It felt the power of the new skill and was taken aback by Xu Ran’s question.

It turned its head, looking at the other four creatures, who all nodded in agreement with Xu Ran.

"Look." Xu Ran took out a mirror and placed it in front of Ziyun.

In the mirror, the white parts of Ziyun’s fur remained unchanged, but the purple parts had somehow turned a deep, profound purple-black.

The bemusement on Ziyun’s face intensified, clearly unaware of this change.

"Could it be... the fusion of Talent Skills can alter the form of Transcendent Beings?" Xu Ran stroked his chin, speculating, "Talent Skills correspond to the source of a Transcendent Being’s power, so perhaps the fusion of Talent Skills produces corresponding effects?"

"Forget it, just a color change, no big deal." Xu Ran shook his head, quickly setting aside that speculation, "How effective is this new skill called Annihilating Thunder Body?"

"Meow!" (The effect is quite good!)

Hearing Xu Ran’s question, Ziyun set aside its small annoyance about turning black and became excited.

It quickly began to describe the effects of Annihilating Thunder Body one by one.

As a fusion of Thunder Punishment and Immortal Body, Annihilating Thunder Body possessed both skills’ advantages and had been elevated to a certain extent.

Upon using Annihilating Thunder Body, Ziyun’s body would undergo a complete elemental transformation. In this elemental state, Ziyun’s body would be filled with a special kind of thunder called Annihilating Thunder.

This special Thunderbolt will affect all skills that contain the Thunder Attribute, adding a unique effect from Annihilating Thunder to other skills: the area hit becomes the opponent’s vital spot, resulting in a significant increase in damage.

Yes, it’s that special effect from Thunder Punishment.

Originally, this effect was only effective in the Thunder Punishment skill, but now it has become an effect included in all skills.

In addition, due to the complete elemental transformation of the body, Ziyun also gained various effects such as the ability to freely change form, instantly recover from injuries, and be immune to physical attacks.

These effects essentially covered the functions of the original Immortal Body.

Clearly, this fusion was an epic enhancement for Ziyun, who was already very strong.

The fusion of Talent Skills is not 1+1=2, but 1+1＞2.

"Very good." After listening to Ziyun’s complete introduction, Xu Ran could hardly suppress a smile, "There are still eight talent skill fusion stones left."

"Meow~" (Then let’s save up again.)

Ziyun opened his mouth without hesitation.

Twenty-six talent skill fusion stones were enough to successfully fuse two Talent Skills, also to Ziyun’s pleasant surprise.

The remaining eight stones were obviously not enough for a second successful fusion, so it was decided to gather thirty stones and then go for it all at once.

With the attempt at Talent Skill Fusion ending, Ziyun’s involvement in resource allocation was completely finished; next up, it was Star’s turn.

Seeing Ziyun become stronger once again after fusing Talent Skills, Star’s emotions surged, but realizing that evolution into the Emperor Species was the most important thing for it at the moment, Star quickly calmed down.

"Xi Lu~" (First merge Moon Concealment Star Racing, then use the Four Star Skill Scrolls to upgrade Night Inspection.)

"Good." Xu Ran smiled and began to select the skills needed to merge Moon Concealment Star Racing.

In addition to Gap Flow Shuttle and Nightfall Trace, which had been prepared before, the last skill was called Starlight Trail, a speed skill associated with Star Power.

Forty-two skill fusion stones vanished into thin air, and the Three Star Skill Moon Concealment Star Racing that hadn’t been enhanced for a long time was about to skyrocket.

[★★★★Chasing Stars (Violent Sun Level)]

"Xi Lu Lu~"

The violently trembling body gradually settled, and Star excitedly let out a neigh. Without waiting for Xu Ran to ask, it swiftly introduced the effects of the new skill.

Upon using Chasing Stars, Star’s speed could receive an acceleration far surpassing Moon Concealment Star Racing. At the same time, its body would transform into an extremely special state called Star Spirit Body.

Entering the Star Spirit Body state, all of Star’s essences would be completely concealed, and its affinity with Star Power would increase.

And this increase would vary with Star’s speed, the faster it runs, the higher the affinity with Star Power becomes.

Adding this brand new effect of Star Spirit Body to the original effect of Moon Concealment Star Racing, it was another huge enhancement for Star, which was striving towards the direction of Star Power with all its skills.

And Star’s surprise was not yet over.@@novelbin@@

After using the Four Star Skill Scroll, Night Inspection brought it another new surprise.

[★★★★Star Gazing (Violent Sun Level)]

Compared to the original skill’s effect of enhancing vision and tracking enemies, the newly improved Four Star Skill underwent a complete transformation with the help of the Four Star Skill Scroll.

Significantly enhancing vision in the darkness was its simplest effect. On top of that, Star Gazing added a new effect that allowed it to release the Eye of the Star once, observing a vast area around from an overhead perspective.

Seated atop the pinnacle of stars, overlooking the land!

And that wasn’t all of the skill’s effects!

The other effect of Night Inspection, tracking enemies, upon being elevated to Star Gazing, became the ability to lock onto an opponent and randomly probe three of their abilities.

To anticipate the enemy first, such a terrifying prospect!
