Chapter 796 - 379: The City On The Brink, Cancan Evolves!_2

It was exhausted every day, yet full of motivation.

To this day, Twelve had already obtained more than five thousand devout followers. All it needed was to keep striving until it reached ten thousand followers, and then its Evolution Ritual could officially begin.

On the other side, Cancan was waiting too.

Its evolution required the cooperation of an entire city.

During the current period of war, it was difficult for Xu Ran to make such an excessive request to others, so he needed to wait for the right opportunity.

Fortunately, after a month of waiting, Cancan finally saw the right moment when all the Evolution Conditions were met.

In a super large military tent at the frontline, an urgent meeting was underway.

The attendees included Fang Canghai, the Overlord Level Beast Masters at the front, as well as a group of Beast Emperors from the side of the Transcendent Beings, and other personnel who bore important responsibilities at various pivotal points of the war front.

Xu Ran participated in this meeting as the head of the logistics department.

At this moment, Qi Yuan and a Quasi Emperor from the side of the Transcendent Beings were glaring at each other furiously; it looked like they were about to come to blows.

"Changping City is surrounded by the army of Beast Field No. 8, within our ability, we naturally need to provide assistance," Qi Yuan said sternly, "Not only are there over a hundred thousand Beast Masters stationed there, but it’s also an essential route that connects us to other cities."

"If Changping City is completely occupied, we’d lose a very important stronghold. Not only would we lose part of our Beast Master combat power, but communication with other cities would also be affected."

"So easy for you to say!" The Quasi Emperor snorted, "With so many Transcendent Beings surrounding Changping City and even the presence of Beast Emperors, it’s clearly a trap!"

"Rescue? How many lives are you planning to use for this rescue?"

The Quasi Emperor’s roar echoed through the tent, leaving Qi Yuan speechless for a moment.

Indeed, this was the crux of the matter.

To rescue this 3 Level city, the losses might very well exceed the gains.

For a moment, the military tent was filled with leaders of varied expressions.

Although Changping City was a 3 Level city, due to its critically-located position on the war front, it had received special attention.

There, not only were large amounts of war supplies stored, but it also housed a significantly larger and more powerful group of Beast Masters than a typical 3 Level city.

This important position should have only been known to the real core existences of Beast Field No. 47.

But somehow, Beast Field No. 8 had managed to find out about this city using unknown means.

In a large-scale confrontation between both sides two days prior, the Transcendent Being army of Beast Field No. 8 secretly split some forces and took advantage of the situation to surround Changping City.

They didn’t attempt to enter but instead, after the confrontation ended, they kept increasing the number of troops around Changping City, even having several Beast Emperors make an appearance.

Such a tactic was a clear provocation to the allied forces of Beast Field No. 47.

I know how important Changping City is to you, so do you dare to come?

After a moment of silence, Fang Canghai, seated at the head, slowly began to speak, "If Changping City falls, the allied forces at the front might be in danger of being attacked from both front and rear."

"We are already at a disadvantage now, fighting and retreating, with our front constantly being pushed back. If we lose Changping City, just like a frog being slowly boiled, our main forces will inevitably be defeated."

"Therefore, Changping City must be saved," Fang Canghai’s gaze swept across the room, "Not only must it be saved, but we also need to relocate Changping City to a safer place. In doing so, we won’t have similar situations in the future."

"I have already chosen a new location for Changping City, equally important, and ten thousand miles away from the original site of Changping City."

Hearing this, Xu Ran, who had been quietly listening, was moved and without hesitation spoke out, "My Pet Beast can take care of moving Changping City."

"Although its strength is not on par with Overlord stage Earth attribute Pet Beasts, it has an unrivaled advantage in this matter."

A pair of eyes turned towards him in the military tent.

They were naturally aware of Cancan’s remarkable performance during this time.@@novelbin@@

With its terrifying body type, it could even carry Changping City to relocate it.

Suddenly, many looked intrigued.

"Agreed." Fang Canghai pondered for a moment and slowly nodded, consenting to Xu Ran’s offer to volunteer.

-----------------

When they truly began to devoutly believe in the Dream God, as the entity connected to the image of the Dream God, Twelve would be the first to be aware.

Although the evolution had not officially started, it seemed to already obtain some wonderful, extraordinary transcendental power from its believers through this connection.

This kept it tired yet motivated every day.

As of today, Twelve had gained over five thousand devout believers. All it needed was to keep striving. Once it reached ten thousand believers, its Evolution Ritual could officially commence.

On the other side, Cancan was also waiting.

Its evolution required the cooperation of an entire city.

In the current era of war, it was difficult for Xu Ran to make such an excessive request to others, so he had to wait for the right opportunity.

Fortunately, after a month of waiting, as soon as Cancan met the Evolution Conditions, such a moment finally arrived.

In a massive tent at the frontlines, a strategic meeting was underway.

The attendees included Fang Canghai and frontline Overlord Level Beast Masters, as well as a host of Beast Emperors from the side of the Transcendent Beings, and key personnel shouldering important responsibilities at various strategic points of the war.

Xu Ran attended this meeting as the head of the logistics department.

At this moment, Qi Yuan and a Quasi Emperor from the side of the Transcendent Beings glared at each other, on the verge of conflict.

"Changping City is besieged by the armies of Beast Field No. 8, and within our capacity, we naturally need to provide support," Qi Yuan spoke solemnly, "Not only are there over a hundred thousand Beast Masters stationed there, but it’s also an essential passage for connecting with other cities."

"If Changping City is completely taken, we will lose a vital stronghold. We would not only lose some of our Beast Master combat power, but our communications with other cities would also be affected."

"You make it sound so easy!" The Quasi Emperor snorted, "The number of Transcendent Beings surrounding Changping City is daunting, and even Beast Emperors have appeared. This is clearly a trap!"

"Rescue? How many lives are you planning to spend to save them?"

The Quasi Emperor’s roar reverberated within the tent, leaving Qi Yuan momentarily at a loss for words.

Indeed, this was the crux of the problem.

Saving the 3 Level city would likely result in losses exceeding any potential gains.

For a moment, a mix of expressions played across the faces of the influential figures in the tent.

Although Changping City was a 3 Level city, it was exceptionally crucial due to its strategic location at the throat of the battlefront and thus received special attention.

It stored not only a large amount of war supplies but was also garrisoned with a number of powerful Beast Masters far exceeding that of a typical 3 Level city.

Such a vital location should only have been known by the true core of Beast Field No. 47.

But somehow, Beast Field No. 8 managed to uncover the details of this city.

In a large-scale confrontation between the two sides two days ago, the Transcendent Being army of Beast Field No. 8 secretly divided their forces and took the opportunity to surround Changping City.

They did not attempt entry but instead continually increased their troop numbers around Changping City after the confrontation, even summoning several Beast Emperors to show themselves.

Such actions were an overt provocation against the allied forces of Beast Field No. 47.

We know Changping City is very important to you, so do you dare to come?

After a moment of silence, Fang Canghai, seated in the highest place, slowly began to speak, "If Changping City falls, our frontline army might find itself in danger of being attacked from both front and rear."

"We are already at a disadvantage, retreating as we fight, with our frontlines continually pulling back. If we lose Changping City as well, it would be like boiling frogs in warm water; our main forces will inevitably suffer defeat."

"Therefore, we must save Changping City," Fang Canghai’s gaze swept over the assembly, "not only must we save it, but we must also relocate Changping City to a safer place. In doing so, similar situations will not occur in the future."

"I have already chosen the new location for Changping City, also a position of utmost importance, and it is ten thousand miles away from the original site of Changping City."

Hearing this, Xu Ran, who had been quietly listening, felt moved and spoke without hesitation, "My Pet Beast can undertake the relocation of Changping City."

"Although its power is not as great as an Overlord stage Earth attribute Pet Beast, it has an unparalleled advantage in this task."

A dozen pairs of eyes turned his way in the tent.

Cancan’s remarkable performance in recent times was well known to them.

With the terrifying body type of that Pet Beast, it could even carry Changping City during the relocation.

Many showed an intrigued expression at the proposal.

"Agreed," Fang Canghai pondered momentarily then nodded slowly, consenting to Xu Ran’s offer to volunteer.
