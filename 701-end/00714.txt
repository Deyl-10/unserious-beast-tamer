Chapter 719 - 344: Fire Ear Bear Vs Fire-Tailed Bear, A Battle Of Fireflies!

```

"Bear!!!"

The deep booming sound of flames filled the consciousness world where Fire Eye resided.

In an instant, a similarly intense blaze enveloped Fire Eye, allowing a strong sense of power to permeate every corner of its body.

The same Full Moon Level Flame Body ignited a fighting spirit within Fire Eye.

It raised its head and locked onto the Fire-tailed Bear Fire Eye in the sky, its crimson eyes spitting out flames that ignited in a split second.

One Star Skill, Waning Moon Level: Fire Eye!

With the skill’s enhancement, the rapidly enlarging figure in its sight seemed to slow down, as if time itself had decelerated, allowing every detail to be more easily discerned.

"Roar!" (I won’t lose!)

Fire Eye roared, its hind legs powering off the ground as it leaped high into the air, crashing fiercely into the Fire-tailed Bear Fire Eye.

Like two missiles colliding mid-air, the fiery Fire Attribute power of both combatants crushed together into a spreading Starfire, sending rolling waves of heat in all directions.

"Boom!!!"

Following a deep booming sound, both Fire Eyes landed.

They grappled tightly together like wrestlers in a match, using their strength to continuously struggle against each other.

The high-temperature flames covering them burned one another, but their shared mastery of Fire Resisting Skills granted them high resistance to the flames.

After a momentary deadlock, the Fire-tailed Bear Fire Eye let out an angry roar, its surrounding flames suddenly intensifying.

Its momentum rose steadily, and the sudden surge tipped the evenly matched situation sharply in its favor.

The next moment, the Fire-tailed Bear Fire Eye suddenly exerted force and flung Fire Eye away.

Two stars Skill, Full Moon Level: Meaning of Flames.

This buff skill that enhanced all Fire Attribute skills allowed the Fire-tailed Bear to gain the upper hand in this exchange.

It looked proudly over at Fire Eye, which had fallen to the ground in the distance, its roars filled with a triumphant tone.

Fire Eye rolled and stood up again, eyes locked onto its opponent.

Meaning of Flames was a Skill it did not possess.

For this reason, it couldn’t amplify its own Fire Attribute Skills.

But, it had the Undying Flame, something the Fire-tailed Bear did not have either.

Who would win and who would lose was yet to be determined!

Fire Eye dashed forward once more, the flames around its body subtly shifting to a deeper and more dense color.

Two stars Skill, Full Moon Level: Undying Flame.

"Boom!!!"

Once again, they collided, and amidst the spray of sparks, Fire Eye quickly fell back in the face of the Fire-tailed Bear Fire Eye, bolstered by Meaning of Flames.

However, this time the Fire-tailed Bear Fire Eye couldn’t quite smile in triumph.

Beneath the flames that enshrouded its body, strands of even deeper-colored flames, like festering lesions, clung to its fur, burning incessantly and causing searing pain that made the Fire-tailed Bear Fire Eye’s eyes flash malevolently.

It roared and smacked its powerful bear paws on the ground, and the next instant, a fiery pillar erupted from the spot where Fire Eye had landed, completely engulfing Fire Eye.

Two stars Skill, Full Moon Level: Sky-Burning Strike!

"Roar!"

Fire Eye, not yet having managed to stand up, took a direct hit from this attack. Its body was involuntarily blown away, the burning sensation of Fire Attribute power causing intense pain that it couldn’t help but cry out in agony.

With its strike successful, the Fire Ear Bear Fire Eye’s eyes once again gleamed with a smug look as it readied its paws, seemingly prepared to strike Fire Eye a heavy blow before it could land.

But Fire Eye’s response was equally swift. Enduring the pain, it adjusted its posture mid-air and lifted its paws high before forcefully dropping its weight.

At the instant the Fire Ear Bear Fire Eye’s next strike didn’t materialize, Fire Eye landed hard and smashed its charged paws onto the ground.

"Boom!!!"

With a low boom, the Fire Ear Bear Fire Eye, which had completed half of its starting move, was instantly engulfed by two pillars of fire that erupted from the ground, and it screamed miserably as the twin pillars of fire twisted together.

Two stars Skill, Full Moon Level: Blazing Sky Dance!

A single word in difference brought about a vastly amplified destructive power.

Even against Sky-Burning Strike enhanced by Meaning of Flames, the power of this blow was considerable.

Standing firm, Fire Eye watched the Fire Ear Bear Fire Eye get blasted into the air, the burning in its gaze growing more intense.

Now, the tables had turned!

-----------------

"Meow~" (Is Fire Eye really okay?)

Ziyun showed a worried expression as she watched Fire Eye flicker unstably amidst the blaze from a distance.

"Now, it can only rely on itself to get through this," Xu Ran said, taking a deep breath and slowly speaking.

Since the initial mutation, Fire Eye had been in a very special state.

Its ears and tail alternated between igniting, switching back and forth between the Fire-tailed Bear and Fire Ear Bear forms.

After the initial shock, Xu Ran had a rough guess about Fire Eye’s condition.

That was, Fire Eye’s mutation was not complete.

Remembering when it was first discovered, its tail had no burning flames, but the flames on its ears weren’t stable either, appearing only when actively stimulated.@@novelbin@@

After being brought back by Xu Ran, through a period of determined training and resource feeding, the characteristic burning of Fire Eye’s ears finally stabilized.

This likely meant that although Fire Eye had mutated from a Fire-tailed Bear to a Fire Ear Bear, the mutation wasn’t very thorough. Inside Fire Eye’s body, some of the Fire-tailed Bear’s power remained.
