Chapter 720 - 344: Fire Ear Bear Vs Fire-Tailed Bear, A Battle Of Fireflies!_2

This incomplete mutation wouldn’t reveal too many abnormalities on ordinary days, but during the critical moment of evolution, it could become a significant hidden danger.

For evolution is essentially a leap in the life level.

The Fire Ear Bear could evolve into the Poison Fire Bear, but the Fire-tailed Bear could not.

Therefore, Firefly, with some power of the Fire-tailed Bear remaining in its body, would inevitably face the backlash of the Fire-tailed Bear’s power during evolution.

At this moment, Firefly was in such a state.

Under the stimulation of the evolutionary resources, it was amidst a stand-off of the racial powers.

Win, and Firefly would completely stabilize as a Fire Ear Bear, hence successfully completing the evolution.

Lose, and the power of the Fire-tailed Bear would devour the power of the Fire Ear Bear, making Firefly’s race completely turn into the Fire-tailed Bear. Not only would it lose higher potential, but it would also lead directly to the failure of this evolution.

And the bad news was, Firefly didn’t have much time left.

Such a stand-off couldn’t go on endlessly.

Because within the resources absorbed by Firefly, there was overwhelming power, and right now, it was wreaking havoc within its body.

In the process of confronting itself, Firefly had no energy to suppress these powers, and if it let them go unchecked, over time Firefly’s evolution would still fail.

Xu Ran’s gaze was fixed on the Heart Burning Poisonous Flame Marrow that Firefly held tightly with one paw.

This was the only resource that Firefly had not been able to absorb.

Because its method of absorption in this evolution was not to devour, but rather to simply hold it in hand.

At the moment, the Fire Poison had completely corroded Firefly’s paw and arm, making the fur’s flame color deepen.

If it could not absorb the power of other evolutionary resources quickly to confront the Fire Poison, Firefly’s situation would become extremely dangerous.

"Chirp?" (Has the speed of the racial change slowed down?)

Cancan suddenly spoke, breaking the silence in the area.

"Tweet~" (It seems to have slowed down.)

Twelve observed carefully, then nodded slightly, affirming Cancan’s discovery.

Xu Ran’s spirits lifted, his eyes locked on Firefly.

Indeed, the speed at which Firefly was changing between the Fire Ear Bear and the Fire-tailed Bear was slowing down in a very noticeable trend.

What did this mean?

Could it be that the stand-off was about to end?

Xu Ran’s heartbeat couldn’t help but speed up.

One human and four pets fell completely quiet, only their encouraging thoughts transmitted non-stop to Firefly in front of them through Contractual Sensing.

-----------------

"Boom!!!"

In the realm of consciousness, Firefly performed another Blazing Sky Dance, sending the Fire-tailed Bear Firefly flying away with force.

The Fire-tailed Bear Firefly landed heavily and struggled noticeably as it tried to rise again.

Its state was quite miserable, as the flames it had ignited itself were covered by an even deeper flame, making it look as though it was enveloped in two layers of differently colored flames.

More importantly, the inner layer of flames that directly touched its body did not come from itself, but from the other Firefly.

The relentless burning power continued to inflict heavy damage on the Fire-tailed Bear Firefly, and even the Fire Resisting found it difficult to withstand such scorching.

The continuous, excruciating pain caused the Fire-tailed Bear Firefly’s body to convulse repeatedly, and its will to fight was nearly worn away.

The other Firefly wasn’t faring much better.

Its momentum had become very weak, and as the Undying Flame continued to burn, it dealt heavy blows to its opponent while also constantly draining its own power.

This draining was rapid, causing Firefly to reach its limit faster than the opponent following the continuous burst.

It walked with weary steps, step by step towards the Fire-tailed Bear Firefly until it reached the point where the Fire-tailed Bear Firefly lay unable to get up.

The Undying Flame, having burned out its last bit of power, finally extinguished. The fur all over the Fire-tailed Bear Firefly had been completely burned off, leaving hideous scorch marks on the skin, looking utterly pitiful.

"Lurrrh~" (It’s over!)

Light struggled with the last bit of strength, punching towards the Fire-tailed Bear Light with all its might.@@novelbin@@

Accompanied by a soft sound, the figure of the Fire-tailed Bear Light exploded into countless specks, which then converged onto Light itself.

Without time to experience the changes brought by these specks, Light’s consciousness swiftly left the realm of the mind, regaining control over its body.

Sensing the restless power within its body due to the lack of suppression, Light immediately activated its own power, methodically suppressing and shattering it, bit by bit absorbing it to transform it into its own power.

It must be fast, even faster!

Light felt the stinging and burning sensation of half of its body being eroded by the Fire Poison, and deep down, it had a premonition that it had to absorb all the resource power before the Fire Poison could erode its entire body.

Only by doing this could it complete its evolution.

As time ticked away, the agitated power within Light’s body gradually became tame under its vigorous absorption.

If there were a score for energy absorption, then Light, having absorbed the experience of four predecessors’ evolutions, had now turned in a perfect score.

Finally, when the Fire Poison had spread throughout its entire body and was starting to spread to its other arm and legs, Light’s aura completely stabilized.

It slowly opened its eyes and locked its gaze onto the Heart Burning Poisonous Flame Marrow it was tightly grasping.

The stinging and scalding from the Fire Poison spreading through most of its body made it extremely uncomfortable, wishing it could immediately throw away this damn thing.

But reason told it that this was the final step of its evolution.

Taking a deep breath, Light nodded at Xu Ran and the four little ones in the distance, then without hesitation, holding the Heart Burning Poisonous Flame Marrow, it jumped into a spring nearby!

The intense power instantly enveloped Light’s body, and the ever-increasing pain made Light’s body shiver uncontrollably.

But the Fire Poison spreading over Light’s body was at that moment suppressed, as if a pause button had been hit, and its spread instantly halted.

As expected!

Feeling this happen, Light cheered joyfully despite the piercing pain it suffered.

The moment it grasped the Heart Burning Poisonous Flame Marrow, it vaguely guessed what it needed to do to fully absorb the resource.

The spring spewing lava was the birthplace of the Heart Burning Poisonous Flame Marrow and would also suppress its power.

This was also why the Heart Burning Poisonous Flame Marrow always floated on top of the lava, never sinking into it.

Under the suppression of the lava, Light took a deep breath and then released its resistance to the Fire Poison without any hesitation.

Its body, already saturated with Fire Poison, began to deepen in hue.

The Fire Poison, previously only penetrating its fur and skin, now started to dive deeper into Light’s inner body as it willingly accepted it.

Without a doubt, this process was painful.

But it was also the most crucial step in Light’s evolution.

It needed to accept the Fire Poison, devour it, and ultimately integrate the power of the Fire Poison entirely with itself to evolve into a Poison Fire Bear.

Being within the lava, although it brought greater pain, it lessened the harm from the Fire Poison and made the process smoother.

As time passed, Light’s body color grew deeper and eventually changed from its previous flame color to a deep red.

As the previously spreading body parts completed their thorough penetration and absorption, the spread of the Fire Poison continued, soon covering Light’s other arm and legs entirely with the deep red hue.

Lastly, was Light’s head.

With the last bit of the body covered in deep red Fire Poison, a dazzling Light of Evolution burst forth from Light’s body.

This Light of Evolution broke through the lava, spewing from the spring as a brilliant column of light, striking the roof of the cave.

Xu Ran and the other four little ones exchanged looks, their faces lighting up with anticipation and excitement.

Success!

The emergence of the Light of Evolution signified that the evolution had smoothly passed the accumulation stage and moved on to the transformation stage!

A moment later, a figure shot out from the spring, bringing up a gushing flow of lava, and steadied its form inside the cave.

One human and four creatures’ eyes shone brightly as they quickly approached.
