Chapter 741 - 350 Talent Skill Fusion!

As a rather rare purple item, the probability of drawing a talent skill fusion stone compared to a regular skill fusion stone is incomparable.

But Xu Ran, from the first time he obtained a talent skill fusion stone until now, had gone through numerous resource allocations. Accumulating bit by bit, the total number of talent skill fusion stones had reached forty-seven.

Some of these talent skill fusion stones were traded early on in preparation for the five little ones’ futures, while the rest remained unallocated.

Ziyun, without any hesitation, used all its value points to exchange for the remaining talent skill fusion stones. With the exorbitant price of one thousand value points each, it wiped out both its remaining value points and the current earnings.

Even so, it didn’t feel even a bit of regret.

For Ziyun, now evolved into the Emperor Species, any enhancement from other resources became negligible. To grow stronger, it was necessary to pioneer a whole new path.

That was the talent skill fusion, a realm only accessible to the Emperor Species.

After witnessing the evolution process of the Demon Wood Semi-Saint firsthand, the one person with five pet companions had learned some of the Saint Spirit Race’s secrets from the Demon Wood Semi-Saint.

After evolving into the Holy Spirit Race, an Emperor Species would not have its four-star talent skills upgraded to five stars; instead, it would possess a unique five-star skill called the Wheel of Life.

The way a Saint Spirit grows stronger is by inscribing one talent skill after another onto the Wheel of Life and fusing them together with the Wheel.

Ultimately, when all talent skills are inscribed, there remains only an incredibly powerful fused version of the Wheel of Life, which is the key to breaking through from the Epic level to the Saint Rank.

Thus, the advancement of the Saint Spirit Race after evolution is a continuous process of talent skill fusions. Preemptively completing this process using talent skill fusion stones naturally meant a tremendous advantage for Ziyun of the Emperor Species.

If it wasn’t for the lack of funds, it would have liked to buy the talent skill fusion stones for the other companions as well.

In the end, Ziyun had thirty-four talent skill fusion stones in its possession.

"How do you plan to fuse your talent skills?" Xu Ran pondered for a moment and then looked seriously at Ziyun.

As an Emperor Species, Ziyun possessed a total of nine talent skills.

The most extreme method of fusion would be to combine all nine skills simultaneously. In this case, thirty-four talent skill fusion stones would not suffice for a successful fusion; at most, they could only slightly bolster the success rate.

The more systematic approach would be to select two talent skills for fusion, and upon a successful fusion, fuse the new skill with a third one, until all are fused.

With thirty-four talent skill fusion stones, there is a chance to complete one fusion.

Beyond that, there are other fusion plans.

Having no prior experience with talent skill fusion, Xu Ran was more interested in hearing Ziyun’s own thoughts on the matter at this moment.@@novelbin@@

Upon hearing Xu Ran’s question, Ziyun showed a thoughtful expression.

Fusing all nine skills together was the first option it discarded. Your next journey awaits at empire

This method of fusion required a massive amount of talent skill fusion stones, and with no certainty of success, there would be no enhancement in strength before achieving fusion success.

The method of fusing other skills one by one with a single skill was also quickly dismissed by Ziyun.

Because it had a better plan.

After evolving into the Emperor Species, Ziyun’s nine talent skills were Thunder Shocker, Path of Destruction, Thunder Punishment, Immortal Body, Heavenly Punishment, Divine Punishment, Astonishing Thunder Fury, Cloud Break Sky, and Imperial Crown.

These nine skills could actually be divided into five categories.

Thunder Shocker, Heavenly Punishment, and Imperial Crown are all field-type skills with certain commonalities when used.

Astonishing Thunder Fury and Cloud Break Sky are both long-range attack skills, again with similarities.

Immortal Body and Thunder Punishment are close-combat attack skills, Divine Punishment is a burst skill, and Path of Destruction is a speed skill.

Following this classification, Ziyun could fuse the skills of the five categories separately, reducing the nine talent skills down to five, and then fuse the five combined talent skills together.

Since there is only one skill each in the burst and speed categories, the first phase required fusing the skills of three categories.

Thunder Shocker + Heavenly Punishment + Imperial Crown

Astonishing Thunder Fury + Cloud Break Sky

Immortal Body + Thunder Punishment

For its first attempt at talent skill fusion, it logically made sense for Ziyun to start with the simpler method of pairing skills for fusion, so after briefly considering between two options, it settled on Immortal Body and Thunder Punishment.

Ziyun quickly shared its thoughts with Xu Ran, and the other four companions listened intently, deep in thought.

After evolving into the Emperor Species, they would also attempt to fuse their talent skills, so Ziyun’s current strategy held significant reference value.

"That’s a very good idea," Xu Ran agreed with Ziyun’s plan. He selected a talent skill fusion stone and chose the corresponding two skills.

[★★★★ Immortal Body] + [★★★★ Thunder Punishment]

[Fusion Success Rate: 0.082%]

[Proceed with fusion?]

[Yes][No]

Seeing the touching fusion success rate, the corner of Xu Ran’s mouth twitched slightly.

The fusion of two four-star talent skills had an almost similar success rate to that of four three-star skills.

Luckily, they hadn’t attempted to fuse all nine talent skills together; otherwise, he could only imagine how many zeros would precede the success rate.

Taking a deep breath, Xu Ran tentatively pressed [Yes], and as a talent skill fusion stone dimmed and disappeared, the words [Fusion Failed] appeared in front of his eyes.
