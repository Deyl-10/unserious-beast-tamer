Chapter 800 - 381: Cancan At Twelve, Double Evolution!_2

```

Why do even two mere ants possess such immense strength?

"Meow!" (Die!)

Enveloped in rampant and boundless lightning, Ziyun burst forth with full power, instantly assailing the Feather Dragon. Thunder roared incessantly, and soon the charred body of the Feather Dragon fell powerless towards the ground.

Ziyun wanted to follow up with another strike but was stopped by Star.

"Xi Lu~" (Cancan is evolving soon.)

Remembering Cancan’s evolution was more important, Ziyun regretfully glanced at the plummeting body of the Feather Dragon and quickly returned with Star.

As time ticked by, Cancan’s massive body, carrying Changping City, gradually moved away from the battlefield towards the rear.

About half an hour later, Cancan came to a stop.

It had reached the spot where Changping City needed to be relocated—tens of thousands of miles from its previous location—perfectly meeting the first requirement for the Evolution Ritual.

"Chirp—"

Sensing that Changping City was no longer trembling, the twelve guardians who had been calming the populace realized something. A golden hexagram flashed, and they instantly returned to Xu Ran’s side.

"How are things?" Xu Ran asked the excited Twelve.

"Chirp~" (It went smoothly! Everyone in Changping City has calmed down and expressed their gratitude towards Cancan.) Discover exclusive tales on empire

"That’s good," Xu Ran sighed in relief.

The second phase of Cancan’s Evolution Ritual required the blessings of the city’s inhabitants.

Since everyone was grateful to Cancan, they would presumably not mind lending some assistance in this matter.

"Twelve, go and communicate with them, and also keep the blessings stable," Xu Ran said, glancing at the idle Yinghuo, "Yinghuo, go and give them a hand as well."

"Luhou~" (Okay.)

Yinghuo scratched its head and followed Twelve.

With tasks set for Yinghuo and Twelve, Xu Ran took a deep breath and looked at Ziyun and Star, "Cancan’s target is too big, and the process of evolution will be very obvious. I’m worried that some blind fools might come to cause trouble."

"So next, Star will start Star Gazing, and Ziyun, be ready to act at any moment."

"Xi Lu~" (Alright!)

Star nodded emphatically, and starlight quickly coalesced above its head into a vertical pupil.

Everything around Cancan and within a large area became visible to its sight.

"Meow~" (No problem!)

Ziyun patted the large head of Cancan below and left with Star.

"Coming up next…" Xu Ran took another deep breath, half-knelt down, and placed a hand on the top of Cancan’s head beneath him, "I will accompany you through the process."

"Chah~" Cancan let out a low roar, its huge golden eyes filled with anticipation and joy.

After such a long wait, it was finally evolving.

As the only one among its friends to achieve the King Stage before evolving, Cancan could distinctly feel the gap in strength between King Species and Emperor Species.

Because as a King Stage being, even with the attribute advantage, it could hardly fend off the fully-evolved Ziyun.

This motivated Cancan to strive for evolution into an Emperor Species.

Now that the opportunity was right in front of it, and the demanding Evolution Ritual was being completed one by one, it was only one step away from evolving into an Emperor Species.

Bring it on! It would not shy away!

Soon, Twelve sent a message through Contractual Sensing that it had communicated well with the beings of Changping City.

Xu Ran took out all the Evolution Resources prepared for Cancan and dropped them into its massive mouth before shouting, "Come on!"

Cancan let out an excited roar as terrifying power circulated around it.

-----------------

"Boom—"

A bolt of lightning instantly devoured a Beast King that had sneaked in, attempting to disrupt Cancan’s evolution, turning it to ash.

Ziyun, who had nonchalantly appeared, picked up the King Level resources left on the ground, with a hint of helplessness on its face.

Was this the seventeenth one?

These fools really were clueless. Curiosity was one thing, but to actually try and interrupt Cancan’s evolution? It had no choice but to dispose of them.

"Meow?" (How much longer until Cancan’s evolution?)

Unable to help itself, Ziyun looked up at the giant figure whose bulk was above the clouds.

The size of Cancan’s body made its evolution hard to gauge.

Hearing this, the following Star narrowed its eyes.

"Xi Lu~" (It’s about to finish.)

Almost the moment its words ended, a blinding light of evolution emerged from every part of Cancan’s gigantic body, eventually turning into a skyward beam of light that instantly dispersed the surrounding clouds.

The sky cleared, and a turtle-dragon-like Giant Beast slowly lowered its head, grinning at Ziyun and Star.

Above its head, numerous boulders formed into a crown, each the size of a small hill—immense in size.

Cancan, evolution successful!@@novelbin@@

```

The delighted Ziyun and Star felt Xu Ran’s summoning at the same time; with a flash of light, they had already regrouped right above Cancan’s head.

Joining them were Twelve and Firefly.

Once everyone had arrived, Xu Ran patted Cancan’s head.

In front of him, lines of text appeared.

[Contract Pet Beast: Cancan

Race Name: Ancient City Turtle Dragon

Attribute: Earth Attribute

Growth Stage: King Stage (1000w/1000w)

Species Stage: Emperor Species

Skills:

[★★★★Hollow Earth (Violent Sun Level)]

[★★★★Land of Destruction (Violent Sun Level)]

[★★★★Indestructible City (Violent Sun Level)]

[★★★★Earth Descendant (Violent Sun Level)]

[★★★★Heaven-Earth Law (Violent Sun Level)]

[★★★★True Form of the Dragon Turtle (Violent Sun Level)]

[★★★★Melt Earth (Violent Sun Level)]

[★★★★Space Break (Stardust Level)] (0/100) [+]

[★★★★Imperial Crown (Stardust Level)] (0/100) [+]]

Indestructible City and Melt Earth are the upgraded forms of Eternal Iron Wall and Subterranean Shape Pond after reaching four stars; both skills are directly enhanced by four-star Skill Scrolls and are merely amplified forms of their original skills.

Forbidden Realm, on the other hand, is a brand new skill obtained after Cancan’s evolution.

"Cancan, what effect does Space Break have?"

"Chah~" (This skill can create an absolutely prohibited airspace in a very large area!)

Is it that simple?

Xu Ran was astonished, but after giving it some thought, he realized the skill was not so simple.

Earth attribute represents the earth itself.

As Cancan’s skills leveled up, many of its abilities had already become greatly associated with the environment, such as Melt Earth and Earth Descendant.

If both parties fought on solid ground, Cancan would instantly gain more than a 30% advantage.

Therefore, air-based opponents were the hardest for it to deal with.

If the opponent didn’t land, Cancan had far fewer ways to fight back.

A skill that could force the opponent to land might seem to lack actual attack power, but it is best suited for Cancan.

Especially since this forced landing comes with the word "absolute."

This means that no matter what the strength, none can escape it.

It’s somewhat similar to Twelve’s Endless Sleep.

Endless Sleep targets an individual, while Space Break is a large-area AOE skill; thus, Space Break is four stars, which is a higher rating than Endless Sleep.

Speaking of Twelve, Xu Ran couldn’t help but turn his head to look at Twelve, whose expression was a bit strange, "What’s wrong with you?"

"Jiu~" (Well, that...)

Twelve looked somewhat embarrassed but also somewhat expectant.

"Jiu~" (I think I can evolve now.)

"Hmm?" Xu Ran blinked, "Your Evolution Ritual conditions have been met?!"

Twelve’s Evolution Ritual also consisted of two steps.

First was to kill a Superpower-tier King Level Transcendent Being and obtain its core resources as auxiliary material for evolution, and then to gain the devout worship of more than ten thousand followers, completing the evolution under the protection of their faith.

The first condition did not require solo killing, and Twelve had easily met it with the help of Star.

After all of its Talent Skills reached the Violent Sun Level four stars, the only things it lacked were the critical Broken Realm Core and the ten thousand followers.

The Broken Realm Core had been accidentally acquired by Xu Ran from the Demon Wood Semi-Saint.

So now, all that was missing were the followers.

Xu Ran remembered Twelve only had five or six thousand followers before; how had it reached enough so quickly?

Upon hearing Xu Ran ask this, Twelve looked somewhat sheepishly towards the area on Cancan’s back.

Xu Ran understood.

The remaining followers had come from Changping City!

Xu Ran had no idea how Twelve managed it, but in such a short period, it actually managed to recruit several thousand followers.

"If that’s the case, then there’s no day like today," Xu Ran smiled with anticipation in his eyes, "Let’s start now!"
