Chapter 663: Chapter 328: Thunder Starts_2

Twelve’s gaze flashed mischievously, the look of a successful prank fleeting.

“Chirp~” (Don’t mention it, you still owe these debts!)

Finally, I can see what it looks like for the other little friends to be in debt!

Firefly: “…”

Owe…debt?

—————–

“Boss Xu, I really appreciate all the trouble you’ve gone through.”

Seeing her revitalized Rosy Flame Demon Fox, Chou Yue was surprised and delighted, but an embarrassed expression appeared on her face, “I heard you haven’t participated in the store’s service for half a month, yet you made an exception for me…”

“It’s only right to give back to loyal customers,” said Xu Ran seriously, “I may be heading to other cities soon, so while I’m still in Bright Radiance City, I want to take the time to give back to my loyal customers.”

“Boss Xu is going to other cities?” Drawn by the content of Xu Ran’s words, Chou Yue couldn’t help but show a look of regret, “Are you not coming back?”

“I might return but won’t stay too long,” Xu Ran said with a smile. “The Starfire Foster Shop in Bright Radiance City is just a branch. Its operations have matured and no longer need my oversight. I plan to go to other cities to open new branches.”

“I see…” The look of regret on Chou Yue’s face deepened, “Well, even if Boss Xu isn’t here, I’ll still come to this shop often.”

“That would be an honor for Starfire Foster,” Xu Ran replied with a smile, then watched her leave.@@novelbin@@

There was only one or two days left until Extinct Thunder Attraction would emerge.

Once he seized the Extinct Thunder Attraction, there would be no reason to stay in Bright Radiance City any longer.

Xieyun City, Monster Wooden City, Bright Radiance City.

With just one more Second Level Town, he would be able to complete all the side tasks for main task 4.

He was still looking forward to the rewards of main task 4.

Advancing a system skill to A-level was so challenging, it must have something extraordinary about it.

“Chirp?” (Can we start the next resource distribution now?)

Twelve, who usually hid in the shop observing every single customer, swiftly appeared and drew close to Xu Ran, a look of anticipation on its face.

It had seen Xu Ran once again cleaning and caring for that Lucky Chou’s Pet Beast!

The last time Xu Ran had done the same thing was the previous time!

“Almost, with Extinct Thunder Attraction not yet emerged, let’s make one last overall enhancement,” Xu Ran nodded, smiling, and turned towards the living area.

“Chirp!” (Yay!)

Twelve quickly followed, calling out to the other little friends with contractual sensing while asking anxiously.

“Chirp?” (Is there an Emperor Species evolution path this time?)

“Not this time, definitely next time.”

“Chirp~” (Alright~)

A moment later, all five little ones gathered together.

On their five different faces, all wore expressions of anticipation.

They watched intently as Xu Ran wrote on a small blackboard, as if trying to predict something from the not yet completed board.

“Loo-hoo~” (Evolve, evolve!)

Firefly, participating in resource distribution for the first time, was noticeably excited.

In the past two days, in order to obtain more resources during the distribution, it had seriously crammed some math.

Now, it was able to perform four-digit addition and subtraction with ease!

It believed, with such math skills, it would be up to today’s resource distribution!

“Alright, all the resources are here,” Xu Ran said, setting down his chalk, “The total value points added this time are 124280, dividing evenly among the five of you, each gets 24856 value points.”

Firefly: “…”

Counting on its paws, it suddenly wore a look of utter despair.

Oh no, it’s a five-digit number!

Lucky Chou’s performance remained stable as always. After a series of ten bets, she brought two red items for Xu Ran.

One was an Advanced Meditation Acceleration Card, and the other was a Four-Star Skill Scroll.

Thus, only one item was available for resource distribution.

The Emperor Species evolution path Twelve anticipated can only wait to see if there is a chance in the next resource distribution.

Without much small talk or pretense, the five little ones quickly began exchanging and trading resources.

The highest priority remained with Ziyun.

Not only because it had only one skill left that wasn’t raised to four stars, getting close to all skills reaching the Violent Sun Level, but also because Extinct Thunder Attraction could emerge at any time, its enhancement was crucial in contesting for the Extinct Thunder Attraction.

Dropping forty-seven Skill Fusion Stones at once, the panel of Ziyun slowly dimmed and the first talent skill that was upgraded to three stars disappeared, replaced by a brand-new skill.

[★★★Thunder Shake Heavenly Sound (Violent Sun Level)]

[★★★★Thunder Shocker (Violent Sun Level)]

“This new skill, its name is somewhat similar to Extinct Thunder Attraction,” Xu Ran nodded with satisfaction. “It’s a good sign.”

“What’s the effect of the skill?”

However, faced with Xu Ran’s question, Ziyun’s expression turned somewhat vacant.

It took a good while before it slowly came back to its senses.

“Meow~” (This skill… it’s kind of like the Extinct Thunder Attraction.)

“Eh?” Xu Ran blinked, “Extinct Thunder Attraction is a resource, how can your skill be very similar to it?”

“Meow~” (This skill’s effect… also generates thunder from the void.)

Ziyun quickly explained itself.

Thunder Shocker inherited the original properties of Thunder Shake Heavenly Sound but gained significant improvements and enhancements.

It no longer required sound as a medium. With just a thought from Ziyun, it could conceal thunderforce in a vast surrounding area and trigger it when needed, creating powerful Thunder Strike damage without any warning.
