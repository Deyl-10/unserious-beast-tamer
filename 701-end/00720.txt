Chapter 725 - 346: Trace Of The Star Town

"I never would have imagined that the bottom of the Silent Abyss would look like this."

Once again on solid ground, Xu Ran looked at the glimmering starlight fragments beneath his feet, his face revealing a mix of astonishment and incredulity.

He had assumed that, as the upper regions were enshrouded in black fog, the lower reaches would be even worse. Surprisingly, as he neared the bottom of the abyss, the fog thinned, becoming more normal the further he descended.

The situation here bore some resemblance to Fallen Star Valley, except the stardust did not scatter along the rock walls on either side of the abyss. Instead, it lay thick on the ground like a carpet.

The tiny lights gathered together, giving Xu Ran the splendid sense of walking on a boulevard of starlight.

Equally excited was Star.

With the black fog no longer in the way, it sensed the dense Star Power of the place, reminding it that a Town Star Stone had once formed here, and suddenly, the probability of gaining something from this trip seemed much higher.

"The bottom of the Silent Abyss is vast," Xu Ran said softly, looking around, "We’re probably going to have to search for a while."

Unlike the narrow fissure at the entrance, which was at most a hundred meters, the Silent Abyss widened to over a kilometer at the bottom and stretched for tens of kilometers, making the search for the Town Star Stone no simple task.

Moreover, since the last Town Star Stone had been taken, it was uncertain if the exact location was still preserved.

"Chatter—" (It would be nice if we could catch someone here to ask.)

Cancan spoke lazily.

When it came to probing for Star Power, even using Echoing of Earth Vein was of no help.

"That would be one approach," Xu Ran smiled, "but there should..."@@novelbin@@

He was about to say that there shouldn’t be such fools running into them, but suddenly, he fell silent.

A shadowy figure slowly emerged from a cave in the distant rock wall, its cold eyes immediately fixed on the one human and five Pet Beasts.

It was a leopard-like Pet Beast, covered in pitch-black scales, enshrouded in a thin black fog, with a pair of crimson eyes full of ferocity and savageness, emanating power fluctuations of the King Stage.

Dark King Level·Ink Scale Leopard.

"Meow~" (Your big mouth really is blessed.)

Ziyun glanced at Cancan, then stepped forward, locking his gaze on the Ink Scale Leopard, and with an unfolding aura, began a distant standoff.

This Ink Scale Leopard was no simple creature; its aura faintly transcended that of the Great Complement Beast King, and although it might not match the Nightmare Beast King, it was only slightly weaker.

Such strength would be near invincible in the outside world, where those of the Overlord stage rarely appeared, and yet here, in the Silent Abyss, the first Beast King they encountered possessed such power.

Fortunately, such an opponent was still not a threat to it.

But the next moment, Ziyun’s expression grew more solemn.

For after the Ink Scale Leopard appeared, another Beast King of comparable strength emerged from another cave in the rock wall.

That was a lion, wreathed in dark flames, with pitch-black eyes that fixated on Ziyun the moment it appeared, eyes brimming with vigilance and hostility.

Dark King Level·Dark Demon Lion!

Two Quasi-Domineering Level!

No, there were three!

Amidst the strange "click-clack" sounds, the black fog overhead began to churn, and from within it, a creature with a wingspan of over twenty meters, resembling a giant bat, flew out. Its blood-red eyes focused on the one human and five Pet Beasts below.

Dark King Level·Ghost Bat!

The expressions of the one human and five Pet Beasts changed subtly.

The aura of this Ghost Bat was unfamiliar yet carried a hint of recognition.

During their descent through the black fog, they had been assaulted by similar auras several times, but those were much weaker and had been promptly dealt with by Ziyun before they could even reveal themselves.

Without a doubt, those attackers within the fog were closely related to the Ghost Bat before them.

Now, in this somewhat confined space, the one human and five Pet Beasts faced opponents more formidable than ever before.

Even previously in Fallen Star Valley, they had only faced two Transcendent Beings of the Quasi-Domineering Level at the same time.

But now, there were three.

"Heh heh heh~" The Ghost Bat’s cold gaze landed on Ziyun, its eyes revealing unhidden greed, "A King Stage Emperor Species, quite the delicacy. Devouring you might just give me the chance to evolve once more."

"You killed quite a few of my kin on your way here," it spoke with deliberate slowness, "Now, pay with your lives!"

"Human, coming here was your biggest mistake." The Dark Demon Lion spoke with a growl, its eyes filled with chill resolve, "The Silent Abyss is a forbidden zone for humans!"

The Ink Scale Leopard did not speak; its aura only grew more dangerous.

"Meow~" (You all sure talk too much!)

Ziyun’s gaze flashed, countless bolts of lightning suddenly erupted around its body, stirring the void as its form became elemental. Then, accompanied by a deep roar reverberating throughout the bottom of the abyss, it appeared in front of the Ghost Bat in an instant.

Its sharp claws charged with tremendous force, radiating an unpredictable and fearsome power, Ziyun viciously slammed a palm down on the Ghost Bat.

Four Stars Skill, Violent Sun Level·Thunder Punishment!

The Ghost Bat screeched, its body "bursting" into numerous small bats that instantly scattered.

A few bats were devoured by the explosion of Thunder Punishment, but the vast majority escaped unharmed, reassembling at another location to reform the shape of the Ghost Bat.
