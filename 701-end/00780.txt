Chapter 784 - 372: Ji Xuan Draws His Knife_2

The Demon Abyss Dragon let out a fierce roar, and a gigantic claw suddenly raised, covered with the pitch-black Dark Power that transformed into rolling black flames, instantly magnifying the claw more than tenfold, as it smashed down towards Xu Ran with the momentum to blot out the skies.

It’s over! Arrogant humans!

Seeing this scene, the Zhou Family’s younger generation finally breathed a sigh of relief.

Surely they couldn’t really let this guy defeat Zhou Huanfeng’s Demon Abyss Dragon with individual combat power, could they?

Fang Canghai couldn’t help feeling anxious as well.

If it was just the King’s Power, Xu Ran might have had a chance to win, but with the addition of the more suppressive Imperial Crown, how could Xu Ran possibly win?

In his anxiety, Fang Canghai’s gaze unintentionally swept over Xu Ran’s six Pet Beasts left outside the arena, and then his expression slightly froze.

Why aren’t any of them showing a worried look?

The six Pet Beasts of course wouldn’t worry. Your journey continues with empire

Because they had all seen Xu Ran’s sparring with Ziyun the day before.

In that bout, although Xu Ran ultimately lost, it wasn’t due to being overpowered by the pressure of the realm.

In his words, if humans from another world could completely defeat Transcendent Beings through individual combat power, then there must be a way to counter both the King’s Power and the Imperial Crown.

And that method, he had already found it.

In the arena, just when everyone thought there was no more suspense in this battle, a change once again occurred.

A point of golden light at Xu Ran’s brow shone dazzlingly like the sun, his heartbeat like thunderous war drums, as rolling Essence Force surged around him.

Divine Sense, qi and blood, Essence Force, three distinct powers bloomed all at once, and ultimately merged together, forming a wisp of profound Power.

That Power, like an invisible membrane, completely enveloped Xu Ran’s body.

In an instant, the surrounding pressure vanished like smoke.

Watching the shadow of the claw about to fall, Xu Ran neither dodged nor evaded, his hand gripping the sword tightened, then, to the astonishment of all onlookers, he closed his eyes!

The swordsmanship, was listening!

The overpowering swordsmanship surged like relentless waves, spreading out in all directions.

Within the unique vision of the sword, Xu Ran saw the enormous claw shrouded in black flames, saw the overwhelming power of this strike, and also saw the fleeting flaw.

Xu Ran opened his eyes, a flash of brilliance in an instant, and his sword moved accordingly.

One strike.

As elusive as an antelope hanging by its horns, a traceless strike.

Before the eyes of all, Xu Ran with a single slash, severed the sky of black flames.

Sky-Cleaving Six Sabers first saber—Piercing Cloud Stance!

Accompanying the Demon Abyss Dragon’s painful howl, Ji Xuan’s pupils sharply contracted as he abruptly stood up.

This strike, for some reason, he felt as if he saw a shadow of himself in it.

Yet it wasn’t entirely his own.

It was mixed with some profound elements that he had yet to see through.

At this moment, Ji Xuan felt an excited thrill of discovery.

It wasn’t a wasted trip, not a wasted trip at all!

Xu Ran’s sword, moved once again.

Not giving the Demon Abyss Dragon a chance to continue, after slashing open its flaw and severely damaging its claw with one strike, Xu Ran’s sword drew a bright arc in the air.

The arc was like a beam of light cutting through Darkness, completely severing the darkness covered by the Imperial Crown, the swordsmanship soared like a long rainbow, in an instant already at the Demon Abyss Dragon’s side.

Sky-Cleaving Six Sabers second saber—Crescent Slash!

"Hum—"

A low buzzing sound rang out, an invisible force stood between the sword’s momentum and the Demon Abyss Dragon, the previously unstoppable swordsmanship seemed to cut into cotton, instantly dissolving away.

Zhou Polu had taken action.

"This battle, Xu Ran, young friend, wins."

Zhou Polu declared the victor of this sparring match in a solemn voice, his gaze shifting toward the Zhou Family’s youth, heads bowed low, "Do you have any objections?"

Objections?

The young members of the Zhou Family were like quails.

Having been so dominated by a Beast Master of the same stage, how could they dare object?

Zhou Huanfeng took a deep look at Xu Ran, raising his hand to send the injured Demon Abyss Dragon back to the place it was summoned from.

Their beast-taming family clans had specialized places to care for them, where injured Pet Beasts could receive immediate treatment and care.

Watching the family’s young ones keeping silent, a trace of a smile flickered in Zhou Polu’s eyes.

Although Xu Ran had won against their family member, didn’t it precisely prove the effectiveness of that cultivation method?

Although part of it was due to Xu Ran’s exquisite swordsmanship, when Xu Ran resolved the pressure of the King’s Power and the Imperial Crown, it was completely unrelated to swordsmanship.

To be able to dissipate such oppression from higher-order Transcendent Beings was enormously significant.

Thinking of the Zhou Family’s future with this cultivation method, Zhou Polu’s smile could hardly be suppressed.

"Next, the second round..."

"No need for a second round," Ji Xuan said, a flash-step bringing him to the platform, "This kind of spar is enough with just one round."

If anyone else had interrupted Zhou Polu, he would likely have become furious.

But since it was Ji Xuan who interrupted, Zhou Polu naturally wouldn’t mind.

"Old Ji, what are you thinking?"

Seeing Ji Xuan on the platform, he knew the man was up to something.

Ji Xuan didn’t answer Zhou Polu, but instead turned to look at the surprised Xu Ran.

"You’re Xu Ran, right?" Ji Xuan drew his long saber from his waist, "I’ve suppressed my strength to the King Level."

"Dare to give it a try?"

"This…" Xu Ran blinked, unable to help himself.

Why was he not playing by the rules?

This man named Ji Xuan was an old friend of Zhou Polu, and most likely at the level of an Epic Beast Master.

Why would such a high-level Beast Master bother to compete with him?

Internally questioning, Xu Ran couldn’t help but give Ji Xuan another look.

Back in the Guest Reception Hall, he had felt something familiar about the man.

Now, as Ji Xuan drew his saber, that faint sense of familiarity suddenly grew stronger.

But Xu Ran still couldn’t figure out why the man seemed familiar.

Well, he could think about it slowly during the spar.

As his thoughts raced, Xu Ran gripped his long saber more tightly.

"Senior, please enlighten me."@@novelbin@@

-----------------

It was Zhou Polu who made the announcement.

"This battle, the victory goes to young friend Xu Ran," Zhou Polu declared solemnly, his gaze shifting to each of the Zhou Family youths bowing their heads, "Do you have any objections?"

Objections?

The youths of the Zhou Family were like quails.

Having been so humiliated by a Beast Master of the same stage, how could they dare to object?

Zhou Huanfeng looked deeply at Xu Ran and raised his hand to send the injured Demon Abyss Dragon back to its summoning place.

Such Beast Master families always had a special place for the fostering of their Pet Beasts, where injured beasts could receive immediate treatment and care.

Seeing the family’s youths silent one by one, a hint of a smile flashed in Zhou Polu’s eyes.

Although Xu Ran had defeated their own, wasn’t that precisely the proof of the prowess of the cultivation method?

Although it involved the other party’s exquisite swordsmanship, when Xu Ran dissolved the King’s Power and the pressure of the Imperial Crown, it had nothing to do with his swordsmanship at all.

To be able to resist the suppression of such a high-level Transcendent Being was of great significance.

Thinking of the future of the Zhou Family having this cultivation method, Zhou Polu found it impossible to suppress the smile tugging at his lips.

"Next up, the second round..."

"No need for a second round," Ji Xuan said with a flash-step onto the platform, "This kind of spar is enough with just one round."

If anyone else had interrupted Zhou Polu, he would likely have become furious.

But since it was Ji Xuan who interrupted, Zhou Polu naturally wouldn’t mind.
