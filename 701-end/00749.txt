Chapter 665: Chapter 328: Thunder Starts_4

“Xi Lu~” (Let me give it a try.)

Ziyun nodded and cast the spell again.

This time, all companions except Cancan were enhanced, and Ziyun’s consumption clearly slowed down, with its own recovery rate now sufficient to make up for it.

“Cha~” (It seems I temporarily can’t be enhanced.)

Seeing this, Cancan immediately became disheartened.

“It’s okay, you’re already very strong on your own,” Xu Ran gently patted Cancan’s head and spoke with a smile, “And you have your own skill that amplifies your strength. This time’s resource allocation allows us to upgrade Jiezimixu to four stars.”@@novelbin@@

“Cha~” (Oh, right!)

Cancan’s eyes lit up, and a look of eagerness appeared on its face.

In this resource allocation, Ziyun completed all its enhancements and thus gained the chance to exchange for skill fusion stones.

New skills, let’s go!

—————–

However, when facing Xu Ran’s inquiry, Ziyun’s expression appeared somewhat blank.

After a while, it slowly came back to its senses.

“Meow~” (This skill… it’s similar to Extinct Thunder Attraction.)

“Eh?” Xu Ran blinked, “Extinct Thunder Attraction is a resource; how can your skill look like it?”

“Meow~” (The effect of this skill is also to create thunder out of the void…)

Ziyun quickly explained.

Thunder Shocker inherited the characteristics of the original Thunder Shake Heavenly Sound, with significant enhancements and improvements.

It no longer required sound as the medium; with just a thought from Ziyun, it could hide Thunderforce within a massive range and trigger it when necessary, creating powerful Thunder Strike damage without any warning.

As Ziyun said, this process was very similar to the external performance of Extinct Thunder Attraction, the only difference probably being that the triggered Thunder Strike effect wasn’t as terrifying as that of Extinct Thunder Attraction.

“Is that so…” After hearing Ziyun’s description, Xu Ran stroked his chin, a thoughtful expression appearing on his face.

A moment later, his eyes grew brighter.

“It seems this skill is indeed a good omen,” Xu Ran’s face filled with a thick smile, “I have a bold idea. If it can be realized, our chances of fighting for Extinct Thunder Attraction will increase considerably.”

“Meow?” (What’s the idea?)

Ziyun asked curiously.

“We’ll talk about it later,” Xu Ran said with a mysterious smile, “Let’s continue with resource allocation.”

“Now that all your skills have been upgraded to four stars and the stars-upgraded skills also meet the evolution conditions, the only thing left is skill proficiency.”

“Meow~” (Exchange for skill points!)

Ziyun spoke without hesitation.

Its main material for evolution was only the Extinct Thunder Attraction left, with no room for improvement elsewhere for the time being. What it could do now was upgrade the remaining three talent skills to the Violent Sun Level.

By doing so, with all skills at four stars, and all skills at the Violent Sun Level, it would reach the truly invincible state of the General stage.

“Okay,” Xu Ran nodded and quickly started allocating points.

Ziyun had been busy in the past half-month as well, with its skill proficiency continuously rising rapidly, so after consuming over ten thousand skill points, it achieved the goal of having all skills at the Violent Sun Level.

“Meow!” (I’m finished!)

Feeling the powerful force surging within it, Ziyun declared the end of its exchange with satisfaction.

By the next resource allocation, if nothing went wrong, its evolution would have been completed, and its priority for exchange would also disappear.

It was time to give other companions a chance.

“Xi Lu~” (Is it my turn now?)

Ziyun let out an excited screech.

Its gaze instantly fell on the words “Four-Star Skill Scrolls” on Little Black’s board.

Ziyun had its own plan for its last skill, so it didn’t use that item. Thus, the best user for this item naturally became itself.

And it just happened to have an application for the four-star skill scrolls.

“Xi Lu~” (Use the four-star skill scrolls on the Night Rune!)

Star didn’t hesitate to speak up.

Choosing this skill, it had its own considerations.

First, Star hadn’t found any suitable skills to fuse with this one yet, so upgrading directly with a four-star skill scroll wasn’t a waste.

Furthermore, and most importantly,

the competition for the Extinct Thunder Attraction, which could come at any time, was bound to be brutal.

And by upgrading this skill to four stars, it could offer better assistance to everyone.

“Meow~” (Thank you~)

Ziyun took a deep look at Star and instantly understood the other’s intention.

Xu Ran also understood Star’s intention and, with a slight smile, used the four-star skill scroll.

Dazzling red light, accompanied by the Night Rune, dissipated on Star’s panel, replaced by a brand-new skill.

[★★★ Night Rune (Violent Sun Level)]

[★★★★ Star God Blessing (Violent Sun Level)]

“Hmm?” Looking at the new skill, surprise painted Xu Ran’s face, “Is there a surprise?”

Star’s evolution conditions, in addition to all talent skills being upgraded to four stars, also required at least three upgraded skills to be linked with Star Power.

After a discussion between Xu Ran and Star, they concluded that although the evolution conditions required three, having more skills linked with Star Power might help with the ultimate evolution.

Night Rune was purely a Dark Skill and had nothing to do with Star Power.

Xu Ran had thought that using a four-star skill scroll to upgrade would not result in the new four-star skill being linked with Star Power.

Unexpectedly, there was such a pleasant surprise.

“How does this new skill perform?” Xu Ran couldn’t help but ask as he watched Star regain its senses from the daze.

Star didn’t answer.

Or rather, it responded with its actions.

In an instant, dazzling starlight appeared under the feet of Xu Ran and the other four pets, intertwining in the void into mysterious patterns, forming an indestructible protective force.

The aura of each individual and pet climbed steadily with every breath they took.

The original Night Rune had already greatly boosted their strength, but the Star God Blessing was now even more terrifyingly potent.

Even Cancan, who had reached the King Stage, felt like her power had almost doubled under the amplification of Star God Blessing.

But a powerful skill inevitably came with equally significant consumption.

After displaying the skill for a short while, Star had to dissipate the power of Star God Blessing.

Its aura was notably more wilted than before, a rare condition for a creature that normally seemed to have boundless stamina.

Quickly casting Night Prayer, Star soon replenished the consumed power, but a lingering trepidation remained on its face.

“It seems that, although this skill is strong, we cannot fully deploy it for now,” Xu Ran nodded slightly, understanding, “It might be related to Cancan too. Amplifying a General Level to boost a King Stage is naturally a great drain.”

“Star, try bypassing Cancan and amplify the rest of us.”

“Xi Lu~” (I’ll give it a try.)

Star nodded and used the skill again.

This time, all the other pets except Cancan benefited from the boost, and Star’s consumption slowed noticeably, its own recovery rate now sufficient to compensate.

“Chah~” (It seems I can’t be boosted for now.)

Cancan immediately became disheartened upon seeing this.

“It’s okay, you’re already very strong,” Xu Ran gently stroked Cancan’s head and smiled, “Plus, you have your own power-boosting skills, and this time, we can upgrade Jiezimixu to four stars.”

“Chah~” (Right!)

Cancan’s eyes lit up, eager to try.

With this resource allocation, Ziyun completed all its upgrades and had the chance to exchange for a skill fusion stone.

New skills, charge forward!
