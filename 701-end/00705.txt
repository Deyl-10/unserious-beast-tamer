Chapter 710 - 340: Late Night Emo? What The Heck!

"Here, these two bowls are yours."

Soon, Xu Ran brought over two bowls just like the one before and placed them in front of the Lingli Beast.

"Squeak!" (So much!)

Seeing the food bowls in front of it emanating a familiar and tempting aroma, the Lingli Beast couldn’t help but swallow its saliva, a glint of stealthy joy flashing in its small eyes.

It pounced quickly, directly sticking its paws into the food bowls, grabbing mouthfuls of food from the bowls one after another and sending them to its mouth.

Relishing the delightful taste identical to what it had experienced a moment ago, the Lingli Beast’s eyes instantly narrowed in satisfaction.

The joy of binge-eating, who understands it!

Watching the Lingli Beast swiftly finish off the second bowl and sit on a large rock nearby to rest briefly before preparing to devour the third, Xu Ran stood by with crossed arms and a smile on his face.

The two bowls appeared to be a lot, but they were a special comfort meal Xu Ran had prepared specifically for the Lingli Beast.

A Pet Beast’s eating quantity is not measured by the weight or volume of the ingredients but by the energy content of the food.

If the energy content of the food is low, even if they eat several times their own volume, a Pet Beast might still be in a state of hunger.

But if the food contains a strong energy content, it’s possible they’ll feel full after just one bite.

The Lingli Beast’s growth stage was at the Leadership Stage, but the two portions Xu Ran had prepared for it were configured for the Transcendent Stage.

Although there were two full bowls, for the Lingli Beast, they were barely worth mentioning.

This way, it wouldn’t put too much strain on its body.

And because it was only a reduced configuration, after Xu Ran’s careful adjustments, the taste of the food was almost indistinguishable from the original recipe.

In fact, the Lingli Beast, already satiated, was not very aware of its own state and naturally could not sense the reduction in the food’s energy.

Furthermore, Xu Ran added quite a few digestive aids to the two bowls of food, making it even less likely to affect the Lingli Beast.

Seeing the Lingli Beast, wholly unaware of anything amiss, continuously providing him with pleasure value, Xu Ran’s smile grew even wider.

He was curious about what kind of reaction the organizers from the Beast Master Association, who had set up this challenge for him, would have upon seeing this scene.

-----------------

"How is it? Is the Lingli Beast eating a lot?"

In the Beast Master Association’s meeting room, the other judges eagerly focused their attention on Zhao, the Lingli Beast’s Beast Master.

"Hehe, it has already finished the second portion," said Zhao with a trace of amusement in his expression, "That point, he’s got it in the bag."

"Haha, at last, we have put the owner of the Starfire Foster Care Shop in a difficult position," said Old Zhou, whose plans had previously failed, with a smile on his face. "This is the ultimate no-win challenge, practically unsolvable."

The other judges nodded in agreement.

Indeed, this challenge, in a certain sense, was unsolvable.

Whether to give the Lingli Beast more food or not, both ways were wrong.

If given, then the Lingli Beast would feel too full and uncomfortable, naturally leading to a decreased experience.

If not given, the Lingli Beast wouldn’t feel satisfied, and the experience would similarly decline.

"Old Zhao, the Lingli Beast must be overfed by now, right? After all, it’s two portions of food," asked another judge, "If the Lingli Beast is now feeling unwell, we can directly deduct points from Starfire Foster Care Shop."

"Hmm, let me check," Zhao nodded and began to carefully sense the Lingli Beast’s condition using contractual sensing.

After a moment, his smile froze on his face.

Why... but in his perception, not only was the Lingli Beast not experiencing any discomfort from overeating, but its state of having eaten its fill had been somewhat alleviated?

"... Old Zhao?" Seeing the change in Zhao’s expression, the other judges couldn’t help but feel a moment of apprehension.

This scene was all too familiar.

Those judges who had failed earlier had similar changes in expression.

Could it be that their highly-anticipated Lingli Beast also...

"Impossible?" Zhao’s expression looked doubtfully at life, "How can my Lingli Beast be feeling less full after eating more?"

"If it keeps eating like this, it’s going to go from a state of fullness to hunger!"

The judges: "???"

What’s this? There’s a saying for getting hungrier the more you eat?

"Old Zhao, ask the Lingli Beast about its exact condition to see what’s going on," one of the four main judges spoke up after exchanging glances with the others.

"Alright, I’ll ask," Zhao nodded firmly, then began inquiring in detail into the Lingli Beast’s condition through contractual sensing.

A moment later, his face revealed an expression of utter disbelief, "The owner of that foster shop fed my Lingli Beast a food formula for the Transcendent Stage."

"And... he also added digestive aids?!"

As Zhao’s words fell, the meeting room fell into a strange silence.@@novelbin@@

Food formula for the Transcendent Stage...

If they remembered correctly, Zhao’s Lingli Beast was at the Leadership Stage, right?

Skipping two whole growth stages, that small amount of food was probably just enough for the Lingli Beast to savor the taste; it was likely almost digested before it even hit the stomach.

And yet, the owner of that foster shop had added digestive aids.

This way, it really would become hungrier as it ate more...

Not only were the Lingli Beast’s eating needs met, but its health was also maintained. The challenge, initially deemed unsolvable by everyone, was now, surprisingly, solved through Xu Ran’s innovative approach.

"This Starfire Foster Care Shop... is not simple," one of the four main judges couldn’t help but take a sharp breath, his face showing a hint of admiration, "He found a win-win solution to this??"
