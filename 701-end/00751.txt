Chapter 755 - 357: The Might Of Swordsmanship!_2

It was a crow covered in pitch-black feathers, its eyes and claws of the purest black, with a wingspan of forty meters. With its appearance, an aura of deathly stillness immediately enveloped the entire arena, causing even the windblown sand to halt.

"Sssshhh!"

With a harsh and unpleasant cry, the Crow Beast King’s gaze locked onto Xu Ran the moment it appeared. A hint of abstruse depth flashed through its pitch-black pupils, and a wave of intense hostility and murderous intent rapidly spread through the void.

In the next instant, the massive Crow Beast King swooped toward Xu Ran like a cloud descending from the sky, its terrifying and stern power converging between its sharp claws, forming an unbelievably fearsome force.

Three Star Skill, Violent Sun Level・Dark Rift Claw!

Facing the stroke filled with killing intention, Xu Ran didn’t dodge or evade. The Sky-Cleaving Blade Skill rapidly flashed through his mind, and then he slashed out with his blade, unhurried and at ease.

This slash was like an antelope hanging by its horns, leaving no trace, yet it effortlessly cut into the wind of the Crow Beast King’s claws, colliding with the beast’s sharp talons.

Only upon the clash did the hidden, earth-shattering power within the long blade explode like an avalanche.

Within the shadow of the deep blade were specks of starlight bursting forth, like light tearing through the night, instantly shattering the Crow Beast King’s unstoppable assault and leaving a deep gash on its claws, marked by blood.

As dark red blood sprayed out, the Crow Beast King let out an angry roar and was forced to swiftly put distance between itself and Xu Ran.

Sky-Cleaving Six Sabers, the first strike—Piercing Cloud Stance!

With the Crow Beast King repelled by a single strike, Xu Ran held his blade in both hands, his face displaying a calmness untroubled by ripples, yet his heart couldn’t help but feel a hint of excitement.

It worked!

He had seen this cut countless times at the Pillar Ruins, but it felt entirely different when he executed it himself.

The Piercing Cloud Stance is the first of the Sky-Cleaving Six Sabers, and it focuses on perception.

The blade’s trajectory touches everything around it, touching the force of the opponent’s attack, slashing at the weakest point once found, and breaking through the adversary’s defenses.

This was a method of using the blade’s trajectory Xu Ran hadn’t considered before. Even though it was just the first strike, its influence on him was immense.

And the power of the Sky-Cleaving Six Sabers was just beginning.

The subsequent second, third, and up to the sixth strikes, each more powerful than the last.

With just the first strike showing such effect, Xu Ran was filled with indescribable excitement and a surge of pride welled up in his heart.

"Again!"

He bellowed, pointing his long blade directly at the Crow Beast King in the sky.

At this moment, the Quasi-Dominant Level seemed trivial in his eyes.

"Insolent ant!"

The Crow Beast King let out a frenzied howl, its eyes becoming increasingly deep and terrifying. The black light around its body erupted, almost forming flames that enveloped it entirely.

An extremely dangerous aura burst forth from its body, and the next moment, countless black feathers fell like raindrops, completely covering the area where Xu Ran and the stars were positioned. Each feather flickered with a cold, faint light and was wrapped in burning black flames.

Three Star Skill, Violent Sun Level・Dark Feather Annihilation!

Though its rage had intensified, the Crow Beast King had clearly learned its lesson, no longer engaging in close combat with the sword-wielding Xu Ran but instead keeping its distance in an attempt to wear him down.

However, facing the black feathers that seemed to engulf the sky and all the space in his field of vision, as well as all potential evasive positions, Xu Ran’s expression hardly changed.

The long blade in his hand suddenly traced an arc of light through the air, like a fleeting crescent moon, instantly shattering a feather, then the second, and then the third.

Each dark arc was as swift as Amazing, the previous one still not dissipated when the next followed closely, layer upon layer like blooming flower petals, beautiful in their indomitable strength.

Sky-Cleaving Six Sabers, the third strike—Hidden Blossom Style!

This technique could attack or defend.

To attack is to cut off all the enemy’s retreats; to defend is to shatter all the enemy’s attacks.

Xu Ran’s eyes turned the color of the night sky, within which was a galaxy in reverse, each black feather appearing as slow as a tortoise crawling.

Specks of starlight wove above his head into vertical pupil-like patterns of light, instantly casting toward the Crow Beast King.

Four Star Skill, Violent Sun Level・Star Gazing!

Effect, ability insight!

After instantly discerning the opponent’s three Talent Skills, the blade light in Xu Ran’s hand became even more fierce. The sword flowers bloomed tragically in the void, devouring all the black feathers into oblivion.

In the next instant, before the Crow Beast King could react, Xu Ran squeezed the belly of Star fiercely. Accompanied by a clear and piercing neigh, he rode Star and leaped towards the high skies, while letting out a low shout.

"Cancan!"

"Cha!" (I’m here!)

Cancan, who had been guarding from a distance, shared an understanding with Xu Ran and already knew what to do.

A terracotta halo rose from Cancan’s paws to the earth, and a rock pillar erupted from the ground, appearing right beneath Star’s feet in midair!@@novelbin@@

Immediately after, the second and the third appeared.

Star’s body blurred in rapid descent until only a shadow remained, yet the stone pillars raised by Cancan managed to keep up with the steps of Star’s charge.

A ladder of stone pointed directly to the heavens; at the top of the stairway, Xu Ran raised his sword to strike the utterly bewildered Crow Beast King.

"Quite bold of you!"

The Crow Beast King was instantly enraged by Xu Ran’s provocatively offensive gesture, and any budding intent to retreat was snuffed out in an instant.

Transcendent Beings with the ability to fly have an absolute sensitivity towards air superiority.

The sky is their home turf!

And at this moment, the despicable human before it was attacking in a manner that felt like a taunt to the Beast King in the air.

Then let there be battle!

With a steeled heart, the Crow Beast King roared fiercely and swung its wings powerfully. Black flames around its body swept the heavens as its terrifying presence peaked in an instant, its deep black eyes locked onto Xu Ran like an unfathomable abyss.

After a moment’s charge, its colossal wings crossed and slashed down towards Xu Ran. A hundred-meter-long ten-bladed shadow formed in an instant, carrying heart-palpitatingly terrifying fluctuations as it violently chopped down towards Xu Ran.

Three Star Skill, Violent Sun Level · Dark Cross Slash!

This was the Crow Beast King’s strongest offensive skill, and at this moment, the beast had only one thought—to tear the human before it to shreds. Thus, it didn’t hesitate to employ its most powerful skill that it had previously deemed unnecessary to use.

Gazing at the massive cross before him, the starlight shimmering around Xu Ran stirred into countless ripples under the sharp aura, yet his expression remained utterly calm.

Luckily, Star Gazing had discerned exactly this skill among the three the opponent held, so he had anticipated the King would make this move.

Star Gazing’s insight was not merely about knowing which skills the other possessed, but also about being clearly aware of the skills’ effects and essence.

With this, along with swordsmanship...

As the cross-shaped blade shadow neared, Xu Ran suddenly closed his eyes.

The sword’s momentum flowed like water, invisibly surging around him and forming a dense field of force. At the moment the blade shadow entered the field, an energy perspective invisible to the eyes instantly pinpointed its weakest spot.

There it is!

Xu Ran’s eyes snapped open, the nebula within them dispersed at that instant.

His sword moved.

With an untraceable slash, the grand cross blade shadow suddenly became frantic and unstable, as if a tower built from countless blocks had its foundation block removed, causing it to spiral out of control in an instant.

"Collapse!!!"

With a thunderous sound, the pitch-black blade shadow in the sky exploded. The terrifying momentum didn’t reach Xu Ran before scattering in all directions.

Amidst the darkness so thick it almost materialized, Xu Ran’s long sword, like a star at dawn, pierced the astonished Crow Beast King in the chest.

Without giving the Crow Beast King any chance to resist or struggle, in Xu Ran’s serene expression, the long sword unleashed a force that pierced heaven and earth, annihilating all of the Crow Beast King’s vitality in an instant.

A glimmer of confusion flashed in the Crow Beast King’s black eyes, and then all the light within them faded.

Sky-Cleaving Six Sabers, fifth strike—Lifeless Stance!
