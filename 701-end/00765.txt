Chapter 769 - 365: The Archangel Accuses, Semi-Saints Clash!

```

As Fang Canghai and his companions entered the ruins within the Mysterious Light Channel, the departure of a pillar-like Overlord Level Beast Master triggered undercurrents throughout Beast Field number 47.

In a jungle at the northernmost part of Beast Field number 47, two Transcendent Beings knelt on the ground in silence, awaiting something’s arrival.

An aura as terrifying as an abyss faintly emerged from them, causing all creatures that lived in this jungle to shrink back in fear and trembling.

Emperor Stage.

Present here were two of the few Beast Emperors in all of Beast Field number 47.

Within this Beast Emperor-level Beast Field, they were supposed to be the most powerful beings among Transcendent Creatures, making it hard to imagine what could make them display such a servile posture.

As time ticked by, the two Beast Emperors maintained their devout stance without showing any disrespect due to the lengthy wait.

Suddenly, at the other end of the jungle, five figures approached.

The four figures in the rear each had distinct forms, but their power was not much less than that of the two Beast Emperors kneeling on the ground; they were also strong beings at the Beast Emperor level.

Yet, their radiance was wholly overshadowed by the figure at the front, rendering them nearly invisible.

For behind that figure, luminous and majestic Power that linked heaven and earth wove together to form a grand Wheel of Life, crushing down with the weight of Life Level, causing every inch of the other creatures present to tremble.@@novelbin@@

Saint Spirit Wheel of Life!

This leading figure was a powerful being that had evolved into the Holy Spirit Race.

The two Beast Emperors waiting on the ground grew even more respectful as the five figures drew near, and they spoke in unison.

"Welcome, emissary."

The Holy Spirit Race at the front merely glanced briefly at the two Beast Emperors with its eyes, and they immediately felt somewhat suffocated.

One of the Beast Emperors standing behind the Holy Spirit Race grunted, "Are all the Beast Emperors of Beast Field number 47 so lacking in manners? Only two Beast Emperors come out to meet when an Upper Realm Demigod arrives. Where are the others? Do they have no legs?"

Hearing these mocking words, the faces of the two Beast Emperors turned somewhat bitter.

"Your Eminence, the other Beast Emperors of Beast Field number 47 are either serving under the Monster Wooden Domain’s Semi-Saint, having surrendered a part of their origin, or are direct descendants of the Semi-Saint. Therefore, only we have come," they replied.

It wasn’t until this moment that the Demigod spoke for the first time.

"Semi-Saint? Nothing but a False Saint."

That domineering tone carried a powerful disdain for all creatures, causing the two Beast Emperors to lower their heads even more.

"Hmph! Without the recognition of Beast Field number 8, who dares to claim sainthood?" The same Upper Realm Demigod leveled a sneer, "Our Demigod currently represents Beast Field number 8. Even if it were another Demigod, they would have to personally receive us, let alone a mere False Saint."

"The False Saint of Beast Field number 47 has sown chaos, and order has crumbled. We, on behalf of Beast Field number 8, have come to exact justice," stated the Demigod solemnly. With those words, the situation in Beast Field number 47 was firmly set, "Lead the way."

"Yes," the two Beast Emperors stood up together, not daring to raise their heads towards the Demigod, and they stood at the very back of the group with bowed heads.

"You two have rendered a service by reporting this issue, and Beast Field number 8 will not overlook your merits. After this matter is settled, a reward will be given and your tribes will be allowed to migrate to Beast Field number 8," said another of the Upper Realm Beast Emperors among the four, looking at the two local Beast Emperors with a pleasant face.

Upon hearing this, both Beast Emperors revealed expressions of joy.

Out of eight original old Beast Emperors within Beast Field number 47, with the successful evolution of the Monster Wooden Domain’s Semi-Saint, five Beast Emperors either perished or submitted, leaving just these two.

As Beast Field number 47 had almost become a one-Semi-Saint dictatorship today, wasn’t their risky appearance here precisely to connect with the Upper Realms?

In their eyes, staying in Beast Field number 47 had been because they could be second to none within this Emperor Level Beast Field. If even that could no longer be guaranteed, why not move to the much broader space of Beast Field number 8?

After all, whose subjects were they if not servants?

Guided by the two host Beast Emperors, the group of seven beasts unhesitatingly headed toward the newly relocated Monster Wooden Domain, situated at the central point of Beast Field number 47.

Outside the Monster Wooden Domain, a Beast Emperor swiftly appeared.

It was the Tortoise of Longevity, a direct descendant of the now-ascended Semi-Saint Beast Emperor of Demon Wood.

With meaningful gaze, it eyed the two familiar figures in the party, then spoke slowly, "On behalf of the Demon Wood Semi-Saint, I have come to greet our guests."

"For just a False Saint, quite the grand reception," the Demigod Beast Emperor sneered again, "You know to welcome us now, what were you busy with earlier?"

A slight shadow crossed the face of the Tortoise of Longevity, but its long years of experience quickly restored its composure, "Please come in."

With that, it turned and entered the Monster Wooden Domain.

The Upper Realm Demigod’s Beast Emperor companion seemed about to speak again, but seeing their own Demigod stepping forward, they held their tongue and hurried after.

Upon setting foot in the Monster Wooden Domain, the space around the Upper Realm Demigod twisted violently, and a surge of immense Power burst forth. The Wheel of Life behind slowly revolved, unshakably.

A trace of Power that transcended the ten Attributes slipped out, instantly reducing the ground underfoot to dust, and the very fabric of the space filled with web-like fissures.

The power that enveloped the entire Monster Wooden Domain shattered at that moment, and the next, more forces thundered down, swiftly repairing the ground under the Upper Realm Demigod’s feet and the surrounding space.

In the blink of an eye, the two Demigods had already carried out their first probe.

The Wheel of Life behind the Upper Realm Demigod stopped spinning, and the abyss-like aura receded slightly. Its face, showing neither sorrow nor joy, quickly issued an unquestionable command, "Let’s go, see this False Saint."
