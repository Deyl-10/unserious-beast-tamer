Chapter 772 - 366: Battle Of Semi-Saint_2

The Cloud Crow Demigod’s face changed slightly, as his wings enveloped him. The space around instantly stagnated and compressed. The branches of the Demon Wood Demigod pierced towards him at extreme speed, yet they seemed to be infinitely far from the Cloud Crow Demigod, never able to reach him.

The Demon Wood Demigod’s gaze shimmered slightly, as the blue-gold patterns on the other parts of his body brightened, flowing towards the area where the branches had dimmed, lighting it up once again.

Before the Cloud Crow Demigod could breathe a sigh of relief, those re-lit patterns on the branches once again reflected between heaven and earth, subtly altering the order around them.

Four Stars Leap Skill, Order·Fragility!

"Zzzt—"

The stagnant void, as if made of paper, was punctured by the branches in an instant, the branch reaching the face of the crazily changing Cloud Crow Demigod.

The Cloud Crow Demigod’s figure moved, and the power of space enveloped his body in an instant.@@novelbin@@

He was about to teleport away as he had before, but in that moment, the cold voice of the Demon Wood Demigod echoed between heaven and earth.

"In this place, teleportation is forbidden!"

A golden-patterned leaf over his body shattered in response, and an inscrutable mighty force descended in an instant, causing the Cloud Crow Demigod’s body to stiffen in place. The power of teleportation was instantly suppressed!

Four Stars Leap Skill, Order·True Word!

This was the Demon Wood Demigod’s most powerful skill. Unlike other skills that could only change the order in a fixed manner, this skill allowed the words to be followed by laws, giving the Demon Wood Demigod the freedom to change the order around him.

Though with many restrictions, it was an absolute divine skill.

"Boom!!!"

The branch, like a whip striking the heavens, lashed viciously onto the body of the Cloud Crow Demigod with a low boom, sending the Cloud Crow Demigod flying, smashing a mountain miles away and stirring up a ring of shockwaves in the void.

As he struck, the Demon Wood Demigod’s figure swiftly chased towards the Cloud Crow Demigod’s direction.

But before he could reach the place where the Cloud Crow Demigod had fallen after smashing the mountain, the Cloud Crow Demigod let out an angry roar, his figure flashing as he killed towards the Demon Wood Demigod.

In his eyes, a strong sense of wariness and murderous intent emerged. At this moment, he completely understood why the saints within the Eighth Beast Field were so wary of the Demon Wood Demigod.

The opponent, not yet grown into a Saint Spirit, was already able to change the rules of heaven and earth so capriciously. What level of terror would his strength reach the day he became a Saint Spirit?

This fellow must die!

The Saint Spirit Wheel of Life behind the Cloud Crow Demigod began to spin at extreme speed, leaving countless cracks in the void around them with the traces of terrifying energy. In the surprised gaze of the Demon Wood Demigod, the Wheel of Life actually merged directly into the Cloud Crow Demigod’s body.

Then, the Cloud Crow Demigod let out a violent shout, his body instantly growing to nearly a hundred thousand meters, like a demonic god obscuring the sky and sun, fiercely charging towards the Demon Wood Demigod.

As the only Five Stars skill mastered by the Emperor Species after evolving into the Holy Spirit Race, the Saint Spirit Wheel of Life was not just a simple symbol.

It was a medium for the Holy Spirit Race to run through the heavens and the earth with the power of their Leap Attribute, and was an important vessel for their Leap Attribute. Without it, the Holy Spirit Race, having only mastered the Leap Attribute, would naturally be suppressed by the laws of heaven and earth.

When necessary, the Holy Spirit Race could temporarily become one with the Saint Spirit Wheel of Life, greatly boosting their strength for a short time. This special ability was also called the Holy Spirit Form of the Holy Spirit Race.

Only in the Holy Spirit Form could the Holy Spirit Race display their most complete power!

Looking at the overshadowing figure before him, the Demon Wood Demigod spoke in a deep voice,

"In this place, the Holy Spirit Form is forbidden to unfold."

A leaf covered in golden patterns shattered in response, but only caused the Cloud Crow Demigod’s huge body to slightly quiver for a moment.

"Useless!" The Cloud Crow Demigod’s arrogant voice echoed long in the heavens and earth, "We are of the Same Stage, and your strength is insufficient to bind my Holy Spirit Form."

"Not only that, my strength has greatly increased in the Holy Spirit Form, and other powers you wish to bind through order will also fail." His voice carried a trace of ferociousness, "Demon Wood, you can’t display the Holy Spirit Form, can you?"

"The Holy Spirit Form is the strongest state of the Holy Spirit Race, but to merge with the Saint Spirit Wheel of Life, there is one important condition."

"That is, at least one Talent Skill must be fused with the Saint Spirit Wheel of Life."

"The more Talent Skills merged, the stronger the Holy Spirit Form becomes."

"I spent eight years fusing my first Talent Skill with the Saint Spirit Wheel of Life, which already places me among the best of the Holy Spirit Race."

"The fastest record for fusion in the Eighth Beast Field is eight months."

"And you, you have only evolved for two months!"

"Without fusing your Talent Skills with the Saint Spirit Wheel of Life, you cannot unleash the Holy Spirit Form, how can you fight me?"

"Today, you are surely doomed!"

Hearing that sharp and grating voice, the expression on the Demon Wood Demigod’s face became a bit more peculiar.

Every word spoken by the Cloud Crow Demigod was true.

It’s just...

"Have you ever heard the saying, ’The villain dies from talking too much’?" the Demon Wood Demigod spoke softly, as the Saint Spirit Wheel of Life behind it spun rapidly before merging into its body.

Watching the Demon Wood Demigod’s form swiftly rise in stature and its power climb step by step, the Cloud Crow Demigod’s pupils contracted sharply, feeling the threat of death for the first time.

"How... how is that possible?!"

"How could you possibly fuse with your Talent Skills so quickly?!"

-----------------

"Boom!!!"

Branch after branch impaled the body of the Cloud Crow Demigod, whose colossal size shrank rapidly, the Saint Spirit Wheel of Life reappeared behind it, and then in an incredibly short time, it collapsed and dissipated.

Seeing this, the Demon Wood Demigod’s form likewise contracted, reverting from its Saint Spirit form.

Exhaling slightly, a thinly veiled fatigue surfaced on its visage.

The power of space was indeed mighty.

Although it repeatedly suppressed its adversary with the Order·True Word, it was always somehow narrowly escaping death at the hands of the Cloud Crow Demigod.

After the bout, of its hundred-patterned golden leaves, fewer than seventy remained, evidence of the fierceness of the battle that had unfolded.

The vast area around them had completely turned to ruins, and even at this moment, the space was filled with countless web-like spatial rifts.

The Demon Wood Demigod stretched its body, with cyan-gold patterns of light reflecting heaven and Earth.

Soon, the spatial rifts healed, the shattered land was restored, and life began to flourish once again.

Having done all this, the Demon Wood Demigod looked even more weary, its body descended slowly from midair and landed in front of the Cloud Crow Demigod that had fallen to the ground.

The next moment, a hint of surprise appeared in its eyes.
