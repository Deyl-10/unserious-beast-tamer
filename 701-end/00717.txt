Chapter 722 - 345: The Might Of The Poison Fire Bear, Silent Abyss_2

"Lurho!" (Watch closely!)

Firefly shouted excitedly, indicating the display was far from over.

With a forceful push from its legs, its figure suddenly transformed into a cherry-red afterimage, rapidly flickering across the ground.

Rocks and mountain faces around it were marked with varying depths of cracks from Firefly’s pounding, each bearing the same cherry-red flames as residue.

Speed, strength, agility, coordination—upon executing the Burning Soul Body, Firefly’s overall physical attributes had significantly improved.

Feeling its newfound power, Firefly seemed quite excited, experimenting for a good while before reluctantly coming to a standstill and dissipating the flames surrounding it.

"This transformation is quite good," Xu Ran nodded in satisfaction.

Fire Poison must be an intrinsic trait of the Poison Fire Bear, not an effect of its Skills.

Compared to the previous Demon Flame Body, the current Burning Soul Body added an effect of lingering flames.

It’s a modest enhancement, but the main point is that it has a high compatibility with Firefly’s Fire Poison.

"What differences are there between Scorching Heart Flame and Eternal Burning Flame?" Having seen the changes in Firefly’s first skill, Xu Ran grew curious and expectant about the changes to Firefly’s other Skills.

"Lurho!" (Let me demonstrate!)

Firefly nodded and was about to execute the skill when its gaze suddenly shifted aside.

Xu Ran and the four young ones also turned their attention in the same direction.

Probably disturbed by the commotion Firefly had just made, six wolf-type pet beasts with fiery red fur peeked out from the crisscrossing rocks, eyeing them with a chilly gaze.@@novelbin@@

They approached step by step, forming a encircling stance around Xu Ran and his five pets.

Clearly, upon discovering Xu Ran and his group, they intended to wipe out the human Beast Master and his Pet Beasts in one fell swoop.

"Jiu~" (Here we go again~)

Twelve shook its head slightly, ready to cast Endless Sleep, but Xu Ran stopped it with a look.

"Firefly, these Leader Stage Fierce Wolves are yours to handle; it’s a good chance to test your new Skills," Xu Ran said.

"Lurho!" (No problem!)

Firefly clenched its claws firmly, bumping them together in front of its chest as its crimson eyes blazed with intense fighting spirit.

Interrupt my skill demonstration, and you become the targets of my skill demonstration!

It stepped forward, deliberately entering the encirclement of the six Fierce Wolves.

The pack of Fierce Wolves first seemed startled, then their eyes revealed human-like mockery.

The largest and strongest Fierce Wolf let out a long howl, prompting the others to quickly tighten the encirclement around Firefly.

In a moment of silence, one of the Fierce Wolves leaped forward, its front paws gleaming like knife blades, covered in burning flames as it fiercely tore at Firefly.

Two Stars Skills, Waning Moon Level—Flame Claw!

Firefly’s eyes flickered slightly, and in the next moment, its eyes were filled with blazing fire.

As the flames lit up, everything around Firefly slowed down drastically in its perception, and its vision also changed, allowing it to see all changes in temperature and transcendent power.

Three Star Skill, Waning Moon Level—Crimson Flame Eyes!

As the superior skill to Fire Eye, it perfectly inherited the enhancement to vision from Fire Eye, with a significant upgrade that gave Firefly a tremendous advantage in battle.

The Fierce Wolf that had pounced looked as slow as a snail in Firefly’s eyes.

Without even using the Burning Soul Body, Firefly simply sidestepped and nimbly dodged the Flame Claw, then clenched one fist and, in the instant they passed by each other, landed a brutal punch on the wolf’s flank.

Cherry-red light exploded at the moment the fist collided with the Fierce Wolf, engulfing it completely in flames.

The light in Firefly’s eyes faded slightly, and the speed of time in its view returned to normal.

The Fierce Wolf let out a wail, flying a dozen meters away before crashing heavily onto the ground, with the cherry-red flames burning everything they touched, as if they’d never extinguish.

Its body twitched, seemingly struggling to rise, but in the next instant, it was completely consumed by flames and fell silent.

After throwing the punch, Firefly did not even glance at the Fierce Wolf it had knocked away; it turned around as if it had eyes on its back and met another sneak-attacking Fierce Wolf with a pair of strong bear paws.

The wolf was less than a meter away from Firefly, its mouth wide open revealing grim, sharp teeth, with especially large canines covered in blazing flames exuding a dangerous aura.

Two Stars Skills, Waning Moon Level—Flame Tooth!

The firelight in Firefly’s eyes brightened again, the flow of time in its vision slowed once more, and everything became crystal clear.

It could even make out the wolf’s razor-like teeth and the flying saliva from its mouth, which filled Firefly’s eyes with a flash of disgust and discontent.

The extended bear paws swiftly raised, one reaching above the wolf’s upper jaw and the other below its lower jaw, then fiercely clapped together.

Shut your mouth!

With the tremendous force from Firefly’s paws coming together, the wolf’s wide maw was forcibly closed, splattering blood from its jaws while its entirely flame-formed canines exploded within its mouth.

The Fierce Wolf unable to cry out with its mouth clamped shut, could only emit a pained "woo woo" noise through its nostrils.

However, its suffering didn’t last long, as cherry-red light burst from Firefly’s palms, instantly engulfing and ending its life.
