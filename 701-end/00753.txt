Chapter 757 - 358: Yang Guang Celestial Palace!_2

This was the full-force strike of five Quasi-Dominating Level figures!

Before the attack even arrived, the energy storm and terrifying suppression it whipped up came crashing down towards Xu Ran, causing the starlight-congealed gown around his body to ripple with layers of undulations.

Yet Xu Ran’s expression remained quite calm at this moment.

Faced with such an onslaught, he made only a simple move.

That was to slightly reach back with the hand on the same side as Ziyun, like a runner preparing to grasp the baton in a relay race.

"Boom!!!!"

Accompanying the final thunderous blast, Ziyun’s front claw instantly landed in Xu Ran’s palm; in the next moment, its body twisted and transformed with incredible speed into a soaring long saber.

Layers of Thunder Light and invisible Fighting Attribute power clung tightly to the saber, ready to burst forth!

After evolving into an Emperor Species, Ziyun transformed into a saber for the first time!

The Cloud Break Sky that was unleashed concurrently with the Path of Destruction had already accumulated a tremendously vast strength.

This power was fermenting within the saber that Ziyun had become, ready to explode with Xu Ran’s next slash!

The moment he gripped the saber, Xu Ran exhaled a breath of foul air.

The surrounding void seemed to solidify in an instant, even the attacks that were close at hand seemed to slow down.

He lifted the saber horizontally, effortlessly sweeping it across.

A dazzling saber light flashed by, leaving behind a deep rift in the void, with all the incoming attacks collapsing rapidly upon touching the rift, like a punctured balloon losing all its momentum.

The five Quasi-Dominating Level figures stood silently in their original spots, motionless. After a good while, five lines of blood appeared, and then, under the spurting blood, the five Quasi-Dominating Level figures were split in two, dying on the spot.

The fourth saber of the Sky-Cleaving Six Sabers—Rainbow Severing Force!

This was the fastest strike among the Sky-Cleaving Six Sabers, saber force like a rainbow, here and gone in a flash.

Though it lasted only a moment, it was an outburst of Xu Ran and Ziyun’s full strength.

Below the Dominating Stage, this slash meant certain death.

Sitting within the embrace of the Bright Group, Cancan’s eyes widened in shock.

Flicker too revealed a hint of surprise, which shortly turned into pride.

"Lou hou!" (I told you, they could definitely win!)

Twelve, having no patience to wait, immediately flapped its wings towards a stamp-like item flashing with brilliant light in the void as soon as the five Quasi-Dominating Level figures fell dead.

The stamp shimmered with a brilliant light, pulsing continuously in the void.

This stamp seemed to be only half of a complete stamp, constantly self-repairing in an effort to become whole, but each time one part was restored, another part would fade, ensuring it remained perpetually half of a complete stamp no matter the restorations.

Throughout this process of repair and fading, the immense Super ability Attribute power also fluctuated undecidedly between the directions of psychic and Illusion.

Super ability Attribute resources, True-False Fragment.

These were the resources hidden within the desert and also one of the Main Materials for Twelve’s Evolution into the Emperor Species.

"Looks like our luck is indeed not bad," Xu Ran said. From the first glance upon entering the Core Area of the desert, he saw the True-False Fragment, and now seeing Twelve taking it, a smile appeared on his face.

The two resources they had found were respectively required for Cancan’s and Twelve’s evolution, and along the way, he had learned an incredibly powerful swordsmanship, which had elevated his own strength by a level.

This relic was indeed a good place.

"It’s time to leave," Xu Ran said softly, looking around at the greenery left in this place. "After we go out, we’ll make haste to check out another location."

He had a feeling that the time people could continue to stay inside the relic was not much longer.

When the time came, everyone would be automatically transmitted out by the relic itself.

Without the threat of Quasi-Dominating Level figures, the speed at which the group, consisting of one person, five beasts, and a group, left the Flying Sands Desert had noticeably increased.

With the rapid advancement of Star and Cancan’s constant protection, they successfully left from the other side of the desert in no time.

"Star, continue star gazing," Xu Ran glanced back at the desert and spoke quickly.

Several good finds had come through star gazing.

It had to be said that this skill, enhanced during the last resource allocation, was indeed very handy.

Star emitted a clear, resonant neigh as starlight converged right above its head, and just when it seemed ready to form another vertical pupil, the void around them shook violently.

The next moment, a thunderous roar filled the entire ruins.

Star gazing was interrupted, the converging starlight rapidly dissipated, and the five pets and their master didn’t have time to care as they turned toward the direction of the turmoil and the roaring sound, witnessing an unbelievable sight.

It was a majestic palace rising slowly from the earth, adorned with countless gilt shadows. Mysterious sounds resonated for a long time, and the entire palace shimmered with dazzling light, instantly drawing the attention of every creature within the ruins.

"What is that?" Xu Ran gaped in astonishment.@@novelbin@@

As the palace kept rising amidst the roaring sound, it finally fixed in the void. Once the palace was settled, a column of light that pierced the sky enveloped it completely, as if a protective power was shrouding it.

On the outside of the palace, Xu Ran could vaguely spot a familiar jade color.

It was a dragon shadow that, compared to the palace, was exceedingly small.

"Is that Chairman Fang?" Recognizing the mightiest pet beast of Chairman Fang, a look of surprise appeared in Xu Ran’s eyes.

Without any hesitation, he patted Star on the neck, "No need to search around anymore; let’s head straight there!"

Without a doubt, that palace, making such a dramatic entrance, must have treasures far more valuable than anywhere else.

Surely other Beast Masters who entered the ruins were now making their way to the palace. An opportunity like this was not to be missed!

"Xi Lu~" (Hold on tight!)

Star neighed with fervor, and its running speed suddenly accelerated.

The star patterns on its body, sometimes hidden and sometimes apparent, became utterly manifest at this moment, clearer than ever. With these patterns, Star’s affinity with the power of stars soared.

Prayer of Starry Night functioned naturally, harnessing the power of starlight and rapidly enhancing Star, This enhancement, strengthened by the increased affinity, was much more powerful than before, and it further increased Star’s speed.

With the increase in speed, the star patterns grew brighter, continuously raising Star’s affinity with the power of stars.

Thus, a cycle was formed.

Chasing Stars, as opposed to Moon Concealment Star Racing, introduced the effect of the Star Spirit Body which harmonized perfectly with Prayer of Starry Night, enabling Star’s running speed to increase nearly without limit.

Its body shone with ever-brighter starlight, and eventually, it resembled a meteor streaking through the void, heading towards the palace.

Closer now, even closer!

Only when the palace and that towering light column were directly in front of them did Star voluntarily slow down, its star patterns dimming and returning to their original faint state once it stopped.

"Xi Lu~"

After the exhilarating run, Star let out a long neigh, gazing at the light column that pierced the sky in front of it.

"You’ve arrived quite fast." Alongside the descent of the jade-colored giant dragon, Fang Canghai’s voice emerged beside Xu Ran.

As he spoke, he couldn’t help but look at Star with a mix of astonishment and disbelief.

He had seen Star’s approach just moments ago.

"Chairman Fang, what’s going on here?" Xu Ran pointed at the palace engulfed in the light column, unable to contain his curiosity.

"Well…" Chairman Fang looked around.

One after another, presences were speeding towards this place, and soon they revealed themselves - the other Overlord Level Beast Masters who had entered this place.

Waiting until most of his companions had arrived, Fang Canghai began to explain, "What you are seeing now, this palace, is called Yang Guang Celestial Palace."

"If I’m not mistaken, it should be the only human structure in these ruins that has not been destroyed."

"I found a Transcendent Being of Emperor Stage here and inadvertently activated the residual power of Yang Guang Celestial Palace while killing it," Fang Canghai shrugged, "and then, it turned into this."
