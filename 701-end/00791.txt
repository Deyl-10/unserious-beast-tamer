Chapter 795 - 379: The City On The Brink, Cancan Evolves!

There was one thing that took Xu Ran by surprise.

As the Transcendent Beings from Beast Field No. 8 clashed with those from Beast Field No. 47, the business at the Foster Shop not only remained unharmed but actually became even more prosperous.

In this world, top-notch Washing and Protection could keep a Pet Beast in peak condition at all times, which could make a significant difference in battle, potentially increasing its strength by twenty to thirty percent.

Knowing well that "a sharp knife does not hinder the work of chopping wood," Beast Masters would bring their Pet Beasts to the Foster Shop for thorough grooming before each campaign.

Even the wild Transcendent Beings from the Monster Wooden Domain wanted to receive Washing and Protection.

At this moment, when the relationship between the wild Transcendent Beings and the Humans was as smooth as oil, such requests could be satisfied.

As a result, as the battle raged on, the Pleasure value and various resources Xu Ran collected through the branch stores skyrocketed.

A month had passed since the Semi-Saint of the Demon Wood regained some of its power and secretly returned to the Monster Wooden Domain in a brand new guise.

During this month, the Beast Emperors within the army of Transcendent Beings from Beast Field No. 8 did not fully engage in battle; they acted more like commanders behind the scenes, directing endless waves of Transcendent Beings to assault every corner of Beast Field No. 47.

The Humans, cooperating with the original inhabitants of Beast Field No. 47, attempted to resist, but it was difficult to bridge the gap in overall strength between the two sides.

As Beast Field No. 47 suffered defeat after defeat on the frontline, cities gradually fell, and the fortified positions of Transcendent Beings were cleared and occupied by Beings from Beast Field No. 8.

In the face of such a large-scale battle, the significance of individual combat power was diluted to an extreme.

Even when Fang Canghai personally took action, there was only so much he could do.

During this month, Xu Ran had not been idle either.

He went to the frontline on his own initiative, sharing a part of the logistics work, and, together with other volunteer Caretakers, provided Washing and Protection for the Transcendent Beings engaged in the frontline battle.

With his strength, he could also join the fight, leading his five little Pet Beasts to hone their combat skills and fight valiantly.

Whether it was Star’s supportive power or Ziyun’s absolute lethality, both commanded attention from the Transcendent Beings of Beast Field No. 8. Cancan, at full strength, became massive during one of the battles, and its terrifying body type gave it a crushing advantage on the battlefield.

Shi’er and Yinghuo might not have been as eye-catching, but their performance was still notable.

As a result, Xu Ran and his five Pet Beasts inevitably drew attention.

Every battle saw an increasing number of Transcendent Beings heading his way.

The Beast Emperor still held back from attacking, but the Quasi Emperors did strike several times.

However, the Overlord Level Beast Masters on their own side would naturally not sit by and watch; Xu Ran was a key figure that they looked after, and his contribution to the battle was evident for all, so they naturally would not let him fall into danger.

Thus, in several major battles, Xu Ran had close calls but emerged unscathed.@@novelbin@@

Due to the urgency of the situation, Xu Ran no longer distributed resources every half month as he had been doing. Instead, he used whatever resources he had on hand, and he immediately went for a Ten Consecutive Drawing if there was enough Pleasure value.

To always have Lucky Fish’s good fortune available, he secretly arranged with Fang Canghai to have Qin Can join the team as his deputy.

Although Fang Canghai did not understand why, he readily agreed to Xu Ran’s minor request without a second thought.

As a result, Qin Can, who was sitting at home, was inexplicably conscripted.

Over the past month, Qin Can lost count of the number of times Xu Ran had tapped his shoulder, to the point where he began to question the other’s sexual orientation, shuddering each night and deeply questioning the correctness of provoking Xu Ran initially.

Although it was like vigorously pulling at a Lucky Fish, the results were significant.

Cancan and Shi’er had both achieved all Four Stars in their Talent Skills and even satisfied the additional requests for their Evolution Conditions.

With the Evolution Resources already gathered, they were now only one Evolution Ritual away from evolving.

Yinghuo had also obtained its Emperor Species Evolution Path and began working toward evolution, but this was not something that could be completed in a short period, so Xu Ran temporarily set it aside.

To meet the stringent condition of having ten thousand devout followers, Shi’er began its attempt on the first day it was sent to the battlefield.

After several setbacks, it finally set its sights on those wounded Transcendent Beings and Pet Beasts.

Having suffered incurable injuries in battle, their combat power was greatly reduced, and they had to temporarily leave the front lines.

They were in the most despondent period of their lives, with Shi’er addressing their emotions and using the power of dreams to exhaust all means to dispel the negativity in their hearts.

However, in the realm of dreams, it did not appear as itself but instead fabricated a brand new persona called the "Dream God."

In this manner, as these Transcendent Beings gradually recovered from their pain and despondency, the image of the Dream God became deeply engraved in their minds as the object of their gratitude. With a little guidance, they could be converted into believers.

When they truly began to devoutly worship the Dream God, as the entity linked to the image of the Dream God, Shi’er would be the first to sense it.

Although it had not officially begun evolving, it seemed that through this connection, it could already draw some peculiar, extraordinary Transcendent Power from its followers.
