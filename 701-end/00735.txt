[Main Task 4 has been completed]

Upon seeing these words appear, Xu Ran immediately opened the task page.

[Main Task 4: Branching Out (Completed)

[Receive Task Reward]

Here it comes!

It wasn’t just the phase task that was completed. With the fame of Xieyun, Monster Wooden, Bright Radiance, and Xuanxing reaching 50% in the four Second Level Towns, Main Task 4 was thoroughly completed.

Xu Ran took a deep breath and clicked to receive without any hesitation.

Within the closed doors of the shop, alongside the sudden appearance of a doorway, three brand-new System Clerks materialized one after another.

The clerks were as unorthodox as ever, but Xu Ran was already able to quickly settle his emotions. After briefly understanding the personalities and strengths of the three, he eventually promoted the one who was most suitable to be the manager.

The configuration of the System Clerks in Xuanxing City was complete, which meant that he no longer had to laboriously tend to the shop every day. He could slack off and do some other things.

After settling the three System Clerks, Xu Ran once again looked at the task panel. With the rewards for Main Task 4 claimed, a new main task had already appeared.

[Main Task 5: Sharpen the Saw Without Delaying the Cutting of Wood

Beast Field 47 is about to face an unprecedented disaster. This disaster will affect all cities within Beast Field 47, influencing the normal operation of more than half of the host’s shops – something that neither the system nor the host can tolerate.

Please assist the human forces within Beast Field 47 to achieve victory in this battle. As the saying goes, "Sharpen the saw without delaying the cutting of wood," only a peaceful and stable business environment will enable the host to conduct business more effectively.

Task Reward: System Skill Upgrade Command x2, System Clerk Purchase Rights, System Upgrade Experience +700]

Is that really how you use the phrase "Sharpen the saw without delaying the cutting of wood"?

Xu Ran couldn’t help but mock the phrase while being surprised by the particularity of this task. Find your next adventure on empire

He was actually being asked to assist in securing victory over the disaster.

Regarding the disaster mentioned by the system, Xu Ran already had a guess.

If he wasn’t mistaken, the disaster was coming from Beast Field 8, originating from the successful evolution of the Demon Wood Semi-Saint.

This added a few shades of pressure to Xu Ran’s heart.

But seeing the generous task rewards, he felt he could handle it.

The completion of the Main Task 4 had already brought him one System Skill Upgrade Command, and two more would mean he could upgrade all his system skills to A Level.

Beyond that, the System Clerk Purchase Rights were equally important.

This meant that Xu Ran would no longer need to acquire System Clerks through tasks, but could directly purchase them, outfitting a new branch with System Clerks right away.

Its significance was self-evident.

After completing Main Task 4, the system’s upgrade experience had reached 1300/2000, meaning that with the completion of Main Task 5, the system was poised for yet another upgrade.

The last system upgrade massively improved the services of the Starfire Foster Care Shop, and the maximum rank of Pet Beasts they could service was raised from Leadership Stage to King Stage.

After this system upgrade, the limits of the Starfire Foster Care Shop would undoubtedly rise even further, and the services would also be upgraded.

The future was looking promising.

After closing the mission panel, Xu Ran pinched the System Skill Upgrade Command he had just obtained and opened his personal panel.

System Skills:

[Plucking Fur（B Level）]（500/500）（System Skill Upgrade Command 0/1）

[Drug Application（B Level）]（2000/2000）（System Skill Upgrade Command 0/1）

[Pranks（B Level）]（2000/2000）（System Skill Upgrade Command 0/1）

...]

After selecting the System Skill Upgrade Command, Xu Ran looked again at the three system skills, and three different lines of text appeared before his eyes.

[Plucking Fur (A Level): After promotion, using the system skill for Washing and Protection guarantees skills of Three Stars and below, with a certain probability to obtain Four Stars skills, and gains a permanent buff: Pleasure Value increases an additional 10%, effective in all branches]

[Drug Application (A Level): After promotion, using the system skill for feeding results in a greatly increased gain in Physical Points, and gains a permanent buff: Pleasure Value increases an additional 50%, effective in all branches]

[Pranks (A Level): After promotion, using the system skill for companionship training results in a substantial increase in Skill Points, and gains a permanent buff: Pleasure Value increases an additional 30%, effective in all branches]

[Please select a skill to upgrade]

Looking at the descriptive text, Xu Ran fell into deep thought.

At this moment, he had only one thought in his mind.

Why does he have only one System Skill Upgrade Command?

He wanted all three A-level skills!

Taking a deep breath, Xu Ran began to compare the differences between the three skills.

The effect of Plucking Fur is undoubtedly the most useful; the skill guarantees attainment of Three Stars and below during Washing and Protection, and now there is also a chance to obtain Four Stars skills.

But in the entirety of Beast Field No. 47, there are only so many Emperor Species Pet Beasts, and Starfire Foster Care Shop is only capable of accommodating up to the King Stage Pet Beasts, with very few eligible Emperor Species in existence.

Counting on acquiring Four Stars skills through Washing and Protection is not viable for now.

It’s only after the system upgrades, when it can accommodate higher-stage Pet Beasts, that the effectiveness of this skill can be truly realized, but according to the reward for the main task 5, by the time of the system upgrade, he would have already raised all skills to A Level.

As such, raising the priority of Plucking Fur becomes unexpectedly low, especially since its permanent buff is the least beneficial out of the three skills.

After the promotion to A Level Drug Application, the gain in Physical Points will see a massive increase. Currently, the three little ones hardly exchange for Physical Points anymore, because compared to other resources, the cost-effectiveness of Physical Points has become somewhat low.

If the gain in Physical Points could increase by several times in the future, Xu Ran could consider lowering the price for Physical Points, exchanging one Value Point for two or even more Physical Points.

Beyond that, the buff that comes with A Level Drug Application also greatly tempts Xu Ran.

The Pleasure Value gained from the Foster Care Service, which lies between Washing and Protection and companionship training, would become the most important source of Pleasure Value for Starfire Foster if it could be increased by 50%.

This means a significant increase in Pleasure Value, and with more Pleasure Value, he could get more good things from the lottery drawing.

The final A Level Pranks fall between the two aforementioned skills.

Skill Points, unlike Physical Points, are extremely important until the Pet Beasts reach the Violent Sun Level. Currently, only Ziyun and Starfire among the Pet Beasts have all skills at the Violent Sun Level; the other three little ones still need it.

The 30% increase in Pleasure Value from Pranks is also quite appealing, but since Pranks inherently yield a relatively low Pleasure Value, its contribution to Xu Ran’s overall revenue is limited.

After weighing the three skills against each other, Xu Ran finally set his sights on Drug Application.

It’s decided, then. You’re the one!
