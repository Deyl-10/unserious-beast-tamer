Chapter 774 - 367: External Aid Plan_2

Even if Beast Saints can’t come, Semi-Saints can still send a few of them.

This also means that the time for this catastrophe to hit is not far off.

"Demon Wood Semi-Saint, how did you respond?" Fang Canghai asked.

"Oh, I killed that messenger."

Hearing the Demon Wood Semi-Saint’s casual words, everyone fell silent all at once.

Fang Canghai’s mouth twitched violently, "Killed?!"

"I didn’t want to kill him, but that guy actually fought for his life with me, and when he couldn’t beat me, he directly revealed his Saint Spirit Form." As he said this, the Demon Wood Semi-Saint also seemed somewhat regretful, "It was my first time revealing my Saint Spirit Form, and I couldn’t quite control my strength."

"You even revealed your Saint Spirit Form?!" Fang Canghai’s voice suddenly rose by a notch, his expression growing increasingly grave.

As an Emperor Level Beast Master, he naturally knew what the Saint Spirit Form was.

If that messenger did not possess the Saint Spirit Form and was killed by the Demon Wood Semi-Saint, the No. 8 Beast Field might be angry but would not pay too much attention to it.

But that messenger had mastered the Saint Spirit Form and then died in the No. 47 Beast Field.

This indicated that the Demon Wood Semi-Saint also had mastery of the Saint Spirit Form.

And it has only been two months since the Demon Wood Semi-Saint’s breakthrough.

What is the concept of mastering the Saint Spirit Form in two months?

It is enough to make the No. 8 Beast Field increase their level of vigilance by several folds.

Originally, the Demon Wood Semi-Saint’s Order Attribute and unique position had already made the No. 8 Beast Field consider killing it in the cradle as soon as possible.

After killing the Semi-Saint messenger this time, aside from other factors, the Semi-Saints who could still spare the strength from the No. 8 Beast Field would probably have to come.

Even with the main forces of the Transcendent Beings tied up in the frontal battle at Broken Abyss City, at least five or six Semi-Saints would need to be freed up to deal with this situation.

Moreover, the timing of this battle’s outbreak might also be brought forward due to this.

But this couldn’t be blamed on the Demon Wood Semi-Saint.

After all, that foolish messenger had a murderous intent towards the Demon Wood Semi-Saint, and with such a forceful approach, the Demon Wood Semi-Saint couldn’t just allow himself to be slaughtered, could he?

At this point, everyone also realized the seriousness of the situation.

"Return to your respective cities and hold the fort, and remember not to leak even a bit of the cultivation method!" Fang Canghai’s voice sank slightly, his gaze sternly sweeping over everyone present, "This matter concerns the survival of the entire No. 47 Beast Field!"

"I will now covertly head to Broken Abyss City and try to persuade that Epic Level Beast Master to lend his support. If he takes action, there is still a chance for things to turn around!"@@novelbin@@

Everyone nodded in unison.

With things having come to this point, they understood the situation had changed.

There’s no great benefit in openly practicing the cultivation method now.

Even if a few more Semi-Saints arrive, the overall strength enhancement of humans is nothing but a drop in the bucket.

Solutions must be sought in high-end combat power.

This mission has reached the stage where success is imperative.

"Xu Ran, would you be willing to accompany me to Broken Abyss City?" Fang Canghai turned his gaze to Xu Ran and spoke in a deep voice.

"Ah?" Surprised at being called out, Xu Ran’s face showed an astonished expression.

He never imagined that Fang Canghai, going to Broken Abyss City, actually wanted to take him along.

"You’re skilled in swordsmanship and focus on personal combat strength, which can be better demonstrated under the enhancement of the Yang Guang Cultivation Method," Fang Canghai spoke softly, "Since it’s a trade, there has to be a showcase."

The Yang Guang Cultivation Method is of great importance and cannot involve more people, so the choice had to be made from those present.

Xu Ran, being the weakest in strength and not needing to hold a city, was the most suitable.

"In that case, I must not shirk my responsibilities," Xu Ran pondered for a moment and quickly nodded in agreement.

His current main task 5 was to assist the human forces within the No. 47 Beast Field in securing victory in this battle.

With all the branches already handled by system employees and not requiring his attention,

Now, following Fang Canghai to Broken Abyss City would also be considered helping the No. 47 Beast Field, so he naturally did not hesitate.

Moreover, Xu Ran, who had never been to Broken Abyss City, was also curious about this First-level Capital that had been confronting the No. 8 Beast Field for a thousand years.

He swiftly climbed onto the jade-colored giant dragon’s back with the five little ones and the Bright Group that had been brought out together.

"We depart immediately," Fang Canghai no longer delayed, and the jade-colored giant dragon beneath his feet roared towards the sky before flapping its wings, taking to the air like an Amazing creature, and instantly flying into the distance.

After Fang Canghai had left, the other Overlord Level Beast Masters didn’t dare to dally and each headed for their own cities.

They needed to quickly complete the deployment of combat strength within the Association and enter a state of war readiness.

The Demon Wood Semi-Saint gazed in the direction Fang Canghai had left, then silently withdrew his gaze and turned to return towards the Monster Wooden Domain.

Before Fang Canghai returned, Beast Field 47 still needed him to hold the fort.

Elsewhere, on the back of the jade-colored giant dragon, Fang Canghai began to converse with Xu Ran.

"On this trip to Broken Abyss City, we are going to meet an Epic Level Beast Master named Zhou Polu," Fang Canghai said slowly. "He has his own family’s influence in Broken Abyss City, and from what I know about him, he values his family and the younger generation within his clan a lot."

"That’s why I believe there’s an eighty percent chance of success," he added.

"A cultivation technique can never contribute as much to an individual as having family power can," Fang Canghai paused before continuing, "As long as he realizes the advantages of the Yang Guang Cultivation Method, there’s a high probability he’ll be willing to make the trip to Beast Field 47."

"So, on this trip to Broken Abyss City, we must fully demonstrate the power of the Yang Guang Cultivation Method," he stated.

"That task will be yours," Fang Canghai looked at Xu Ran, "The stronger you perform, the better the effect."

"I understand," Xu Ran nodded slightly, then spoke up, "Predecessor, I have a question."

"Go ahead."

"This Yang Guang Cultivation Method, we’re going to publicize it sooner or later, won’t that Zhou predecessor get very angry then? Isn’t offending an Epic Level Beast Master an issue?"

"Don’t worry," Fang Canghai laughed, "No one is a fool, Zhou Polu will definitely consider this."

"Then him?" Xu Ran asked, looking surprised.

"But he still has a great probability of agreeing," Fang Canghai spoke unhesitatingly, then his expression turned slightly complex. "Sometimes, being one step late means falling behind in every step."

"If Zhou Polu decides to take action, it would be at least several months before this Yang Guang Cultivation Method is publicized. During these months, only his Zhou Family in Broken Abyss City will have access to this method, and as long as the people in the Zhou Family aren’t fools, they naturally will take this opportunity to expand their family’s advantage."

"By the time a few months have passed and the entire Broken Abyss City has gained access to the Yang Guang Cultivation Method, the benefits already consumed by the Zhou Family can’t be spat back out!"

"I see," Xu Ran had a moment of sudden enlightenment with Fang Canghai’s explanation.

"The journey to Broken Abyss City is a long one, it will take three days with Xiaoyu’s speed," Fang Canghai smiled, "After arriving in Broken Abyss City, I will delay as well, allowing you to showcase your abilities a bit later."

"So, you have about a week to familiarize yourself with the Yang Guang Cultivation Method and improve your strength as soon as possible."

"Okay," Xu Ran nodded firmly, now fully aware of the weight of his task.

He turned his head to glance at the five little ones and then his gaze settled on the Bright Group that was being cradled by Firefly, "I promised to bring you out, but now I can’t set you free."

"After all, you’ve heard about the matter of the Yang Guang Cultivation Method."

The Bright Group trembled, shaking violently.

"Puff~"

It wanted nothing to do with such ghostly freedom!

When that Semi-Saint had appeared just now, it had been scared stiff and was still yet to recover from the shock.

"Okay," Xu Ran nodded firmly, now fully aware of the weight of his task.
