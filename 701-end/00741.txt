Chapter 746 - 353: The Mysterious Place

"Gentlemen." Standing in front of the relic’s gate, Fang Canghai’s voice became more solemn, "The key to the relic gate is in my hands, but since the method of opening cannot be satisfied, I have never entered the relic."

"There are opportunities within the relic, but also unpredictable changes and crises may exist."

"Please be ready to go all out at any moment."

Hearing Fang Canghai’s words, everyone remained silent, but the atmosphere around them grew heavier. One by one, Pet Beasts were summoned, and in an instant, the aura of hundreds of Overlord stage Pet Beasts soared into the sky, completely dispersing the surrounding inexhaustible light.

Standing close to You Shengjiang, Xu Ran nodded to the five little ones behind him.

Although their strength was far inferior to the others, they too would give their all.

Seeing that everyone was ready, Fang Canghai nodded, then took out a stone key, ancient and mysterious, full of patterns, from his chest.

This stone seemed ordinary, but it fit perfectly into a depression in the center of the relic’s gate.

Without a doubt, this was the "key" Fang Canghai had spoken of.

Inserting the key into the notch, Fang Canghai turned to look at a few people in the crowd, "You may now take action."

As his words fell, the golden giant bird behind Zhou Qing, along with several other Overlord stage Pet Beasts, gathered their power and infused it into the stone.

All of these Pet Beasts were Light Attribute beasts.

Fang Canghai’s own Pet Beast did not possess Light Attribute powers, and according to his estimation, opening the gate required either a Light Attribute beast of the Emperor Stage or several Overlord stage Light Attribute beasts working together.

For this reason, Fang Canghai simply invited all the high-ranking Beast Masters of Beast Field No. 47 to join him in exploring the relic.

Under the efforts of the Light Attribute Overlord stage beasts, the patterns on the stone quickly lit up, followed by the patterns on the relic gate.

The moment all the patterns were lit, the relic gate disappeared from everyone’s view, and a pure white light film took its place.@@novelbin@@

This light film completely shielded perception and sight, making it impossible for those standing outside the gate to see what was on the other side.

The more this was the case, the more it stoked anticipation.

"Let’s go." Fang Canghai stepped into the light film first, as if swallowed by it, and was followed by seven beasts, all disappearing from view.

With Fang Canghai leading the way, the other Beast Masters no longer hesitated and entered one after another.

Xu Ran followed the enthusiastic You Shengjiang into the light film, feeling the world spin around him, and in the next moment, he felt solid ground under his feet.

He quickly turned his head to look around, and an astonished expression appeared on his face.

When he had only seen the relic gate standing on the hilltop, he had realized that the relic might be in an alternate dimension.

But the vastness of this alternate space far exceeded Xu Ran’s expectations.

It was as if another world lay beyond the gate; Xu Ran looked as far as he could and couldn’t see any boundaries at all. More astonishing still, there were three suns hanging in the sky above his head.

With not one but three Violent Sun Levels, the temperature here was extremely high, and the Light Series Power was richer than ever experienced before.

"Xi Lu~" (It’s a bit uncomfortable.)

Star shook its head, its eyes displaying a touch of reluctance.

While its powers contained Star Power, it was, after all, a Dark Attribute Pet Beast.

For any Dark Attribute Pet Beast, such an environment would not be likable.

"Tolerate it for now." Xu Ran patted Star’s head, looked around the empty surroundings, and his face grew solemn.

Clearly, everyone had entered this place one after another, but there were no signs of anyone around his location, and with no sight of the gate they had come through, there was only one possibility.

After entering here, one would be randomly transmitted to a point in this alternate world.

This was probably the worst-case scenario.

"Star, scout ahead." Climbing on Star’s back and connecting with it in an instant, Xu Ran spoke with a grave voice.

"Xi Lu~"

Star let out a long, drawn-out neigh, and in the next moment, a black vertical pupil pattern light array appeared in the sky above.

Its viewpoint quickly rose higher and higher until it seemed to be tens of thousands of meters in the sky, overlooking everything below.

The vast point of view made everything around clearly visible.

Four Star Skill, Violent Sun Level·Star Gazing!

Xu Ran and the other four little ones shared the view and gained an initial assessment of the environment through what Star could see.

"We’re heading over there." After a moment of pondering, Xu Ran pointed to a dense forest not far away, "There are activities of Transcendent Beings, and it seems there are some special things there."

The five little ones naturally had no objections to Xu Ran’s decision.

Cautiously entering the dense forest, as the sound of footsteps "rustled", a strong aura rapidly approached from a treetop nearby.

"Chah~" (General stage.)

Cancan’s paws stirred up an earthy yellow halo in the ground, and with the Echoing of Earth Vein, it instantly detected the strength of the approaching figure.

Almost the instant Cancan spoke, accompanied by a fierce, monstrous shriek, a golden-crystalline-encrusted ape, emitting an air of ferocity, lunged forward in a flash.

Light Attribute King Species, Crystal Golden Ape.

"Luhou!" (I’ve got this!)

Seeing that the four seniors showed no intention to act, Firefly excitedly stepped forward as a brick-red flame wreathed around its brow, instantly transforming into a fire bear.

Charging with an escalating momentum, Firefly collided with the Crystal Golden Ape without hesitation.
