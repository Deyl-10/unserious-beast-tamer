Chapter 754 - 357: The Might Of Swordsmanship!

"Thank you for the reminder, but we still have to go in." Xu Ran glanced at the hesitating Bright Group and suddenly spoke up, "You’re not planning on following us in, are you?"

The Bright Group was silent for a moment.

Just as Xu Ran thought it would choose to give up, the Bright Group suddenly spoke.

"Pooji~" (Then I must go in as well.)

"Hmm?" Xu Ran was genuinely surprised this time.

After all, the Bright Group in front of him was only at the Elite Stage, and entering would be no different from delivering food to the enemy, not to mention that it had just tried to persuade him not to go in.

"Pooji~" (I’ll hide well when you are fighting! I won’t drag you down! And I can heal!)

Seeing the serious expression on the Bright Group’s face, Xu Ran stroked his chin and looked contemplative.

"So... what exactly is the reason you’ve been following us?"

Hearing this, the Bright Group became embarrassed again.

However, after hesitating for a moment, it finally gave an answer.

"Pooji~" (I accidentally overheard your conversation with the Armored Beast King, and I want to see the outside world!)

At those words, a realization dawned on Xu Ran.

Perhaps because the little guy in front of him was too weak, their attention during the conversation with the Armored Beast King had been almost entirely on the opponent; they hadn’t noticed such a small creature hiding nearby.

With this in mind, he could understand why the Bright Group was so determined to follow him.

After all, upon learning suddenly that there was a new world outside, it would definitely be curious to have a look.

And they, who came from outside, naturally knew how to get out.

Finally mustering the courage to reveal its thoughts, the Bright Group’s large eyes looked at Xu Ran with hope.

Xu Ran hesitated for a moment, then spoke, "If it’s just about taking you out of here, I can try."

The Bright Group in front of him was different from the other Transcendent Beings here, and it also had movements that normal Bright Groups did not possess.

Plus, it had just mentioned that it was good at healing, but as far as Xu Ran could remember, Bright Groups did not possess healing skills.

For its uniqueness, he was willing to lend a hand.

"Meow~" (I’ll take it with me!)

Ziyun scooped up the Bright Group with a paw, holding it in her embrace again.

If anyone in the group of five wanted to take it away the most, it was definitely Ziyun.

Feeling the familiar touch, Ziyun’s face immediately revealed an evil grin.

And the Bright Group once again fell into trembling.

So... so scary!

Proceeding with the Bright Group in tow, the man and his five companions climbed over the hill in front of them and, relying on their sight, soon saw the scene that had been observed during Star Gazing.

Sweeping sands formed walls across the desert, separating the inside from the outside, with the sands concealing heart-palpitating auras, as if underneath the dusky yellow hid unpredictable dangers.@@novelbin@@

"Cancan," Xu Ran called out softly.

"Cha!" (Leave it to me!)

Cancan let out a shout, and as the black patterns flowed within its gleaming golden eyes, streaks of Dragon Turtle Light Patterns flickered around and disappeared, unleashing an unfathomable power that swept over the area, a mighty suppression blanketing the sandy terrain without distinction.

The stirring sands slowed and became incredibly heavy, crashing down to the earth, and the seemingly impenetrable walls of sand were easily torn open by a vast gap.

The man and his five companions walked in without hesitation, the surrounding sand falling still around them, the raging sands unable to affect them at all.

"Jiu?" (There seems to be a surge of Super ability Attribute energy ahead?)

Wind sensed the power permeating the sandstorm and showed an uncertain expression.

"There might be a Quasi-domineering Level with the Super ability Attribute," Xu Ran said with a smile, "Of course, it could be another situation."

"The resources hidden within this desert are Super ability Attribute resources."

At these words, Star’s eyes lit up, a glint of hope sparkling in the depths of his ocean-blue gaze.

Hopefully, it’s Super ability Attribute resources!

As the man and his five companions continued deeper, the presence ahead became clearer and clearer, but within the sandstorm, other malicious presences detected their intrusion and rapidly locked onto them.

One presence in particular, carrying a great suppression, approached them swiftly, causing Xu Ran and his five companions, who had not been hindered by any other Transcendent Beings so far, to stop in their tracks.

"Prepare for battle," Xu Ran said quietly. Riding atop Star, he slowly drew the long sword strapped to his back, a look of anticipation in his eyes.

This approaching aura was no ordinary one; it was likely one of the Quasi-domineering Levels from the deepest part of the desert.

Good, he would use it to test his swordsmanship.

The five companions each responded, but apart from Star, the other four showed no intention to fight in earnest and instead distanced themselves from Xu Ran, giving him enough space to wield his powers.

Ziyun, clutching the Bright Group in her arms, moved the furthest away, clearly not worried about Xu Ran getting into danger.

Seeing this, the Bright Group’s eyes gradually widened, its expression becoming one of bewilderment.

In its view, the strongest among the man and his five companions was certainly Cancan, for it had witnessed Cancan’s victory over the Armored Beast King.

Beyond that, Ziyun, who was holding it, felt extremely formidable as well.

And now both were distancing themselves from Xu Ran—what about him?

Before it could voice its question, a deep booming sound suddenly resonated all around them.

"Boom!!!"

As Xu Ran raised his long sword, pointing it ahead, a huge shadow within the yellow sands began to emerge from obscurity to clarity.
