Chapter 786 - 374: The Lit Star Origin

Ji Xuan had slain six Semi-Saints, which to the aggressive army of Transcendent Beings from Beast Field No. 8, was akin to pouring a bucket of ice water onto raging flames.

It was said that he slew the opposing Semi-Saints in front of all the Transcendent Beings.

After this event, the army of Transcendent Beings from Beast Field No. 8 showed signs of retreat for the first time.

They not only gave up on further attacks but also voluntarily withdrew from the already ruined Zhou Tian City and Bloody City, retreating back to Youhan City, where they had initially positioned themselves.

It seemed they became more low-profile, holding their ground within Youhan City, no longer launching offenses, yet not continuing to retreat from Beast Field No. 47, as if they were waiting for the saints presiding over Beast Field No. 8 to decide whether to continue the war.

And the cause of all this, Ji Xuan, received worshipful reverence from the human side of Beast Field No. 47, though he himself was not keen on it.

Ji Xuan only accepted a temporary residence in Xieyun City offered by Fang Canghai. He refused all visits except for occasional sparring sessions with Xu Ran at the Starfire Foster Shop in Xieyun City, spending the rest of his time in his dwelling.

On the other hand, Xu Ran was not idle either.

After the crisis was temporarily alleviated, he made use of the Transmission function of Starfire Foster Shop to promptly visit the other three branches within Beast Field No. 47 to understand the battle situation, especially the branch in Monster Wooden City.

This branch, following the migration of the Demon Wood Semi-Saint to the Monster Wooden Domain, had also changed location. After transmitting there, Xu Ran tried to visit the Demon Wood Semi-Saint but was informed that the Semi-Saint had not returned since that great battle.

Even the Tortoise of Longevity, which was closest to the Demon Wood Semi-Saint, had no clue about the Semi-Saint’s whereabouts.

With no other option, Xu Ran had to return to the Foster Shop in Xieyun City, occasionally sparring with Ji Xuan out of curiosity about the Sky-Cleaving Six Sabers, and keeping a constant eye on the army of Transcendent Beings in Youhan City.

He hadn’t forgotten that Main Task 5 required him to help end this war.

So aside from a heartfelt desire for peace like the other humans, he had another motive driving him to become more actively involved in this war.

Time flew by, and three days passed in a blink of an eye.

Today, as usual, Ji Xuan came to Xu Ran carrying two wooden sabers, and soon they began sparring in the vast Foster area.

Before long, as the two wooden sabers could not withstand the powerful swordsmanship and broke, the sparring session came to an end.

"It’s getting late," Ji Xuan said, throwing the handle of the saber onto the ground, "unless something unexpected happens, the saints of Beast Field No. 8 should have made a decision by now."@@novelbin@@

"What do you mean?" Xu Ran blinked, asking curiously.

"The army of Transcendent Beings from Beast Field No. 8 staying in Shuang Han City is to report the situation here to their saints, who will decide the next course of action," Ji Xuan said calmly.

"You haven’t left yet; do the saints really dare to let the army of Transcendent Beings mount a major assault on Beast Field No. 47?" Xu Ran furrowed his brow, unable to help himself from asking.

Unexpectedly, Ji Xuan’s response surprised Xu Ran.

"Why wouldn’t they dare?" Ji Xuan glanced at Xu Ran, "Do you still remember what I said before I left?"

"Below the level of a Semi-Saint, I won’t make a move."

"It’s not that I’m unwilling, but a hidden rule has long been established in the past standoffs between Beast Field No. 8 and Broken Abyss City’s Saint Level forces."

"Battles below the Saint Level will not involve the saints."

"Only a very few exist who dare to ignore this rule and attack beings weaker than themselves." As he said this, the image of the Loxen Holy Spirit surfaced in Ji Xuan’s mind, his eyes showing a hint of strangeness.

"So as long as Beast Field No. 8 does not dispatch any more Semi-Saints, only sending Beast Emperors or lower-ranked forces, as an Epic Level Beast Master, I won’t interfere in this battle anymore."

"The Demon Wood Semi-Saint here, being newly born, might be able to disregard this hidden rule and act against Beast Emperors to suppress the army of Transcendent Beings."

"But now the issue is, the Demon Wood Semi-Saint has gone missing," Ji Xuan looked at Xu Ran.

Listening to Ji Xuan’s words, Xu Ran’s expression grew somber as well.

He understood the meaning.

The crisis of the Semi-Saints had been thoroughly resolved with Ji Xuan’s arrival.

But the army of Transcendent Beings from Beast Field No. 8 would not simply call it quits.

Continue your saga on empire

They could likely dispatch even more Beast Emperors and, using their numbers to overpower, could easily crush Beast Field No. 47.

With these thoughts, Xu Ran spoke gravely.

"Senior, I want to go take a look at the Cold Dragon River."

The Cold Dragon River was the river that formed the border between Beast Field No. 8 and No. 47. If the army of Transcendent Beings sought to advance, they would have to cross that river.

Now that Shuang Han City had been occupied and it was impossible to plant spies from Beast Field No. 47 in the Cold Dragon River further north, if the opposition were to secretly increase their troops and send stronger Transcendent Beings, Beast Field No. 47 had to know immediately.

However, it would be extremely dangerous for Xu Ran to do this on his own.

Together with his five companions, he was still no match for an Overlord stage Transcendent Being, and the Bright Group staying in the Starfire Foster Shop was merely for show.

Therefore, he could only hope that Ji Xuan would be willing to help.

By saying "I want to," he was actually inviting the other party.

"Let’s go." Ji Xuan began walking toward the exit of the Foster area, "The Sky-Cleaving Six Sabers are quite exquisite; unfortunately, there are only five of them. Having sparred with me for three days, I will accompany you on a trip."

"Thank you, Senior!" Xu Ran rejoiced inwardly, quickly called his five little ones, and followed behind Ji Xuan.
