Chapter 718 - 343: Poison Flame Valley, Firefly Evolution!

"Loo roar~" (So this is the Poison Flame Valley…)

Gazing at the valley that quickly magnified before her eyes, feeling the heat wave rushing towards her face, the Firefly, filled with anticipation, wore an expression imbued with solemnity.

Its sharp senses allowed it to clearly feel the terrifying and domineering fire attribute power contained within the valley before its eyes.

That fire attribute power was not the same as the ordinary fire attribute power, carrying with it a strong sense of burning that made one feel uncomfortable and unwell.

That was the fire poison included within the fire attribute power.

All fire attribute powers within Poison Flame Valley were permeated with fire poison, and even for Fire Pet Beasts to absorb, it was very easy to suffer backlash from the fire poison.

Furthermore, this fire poison was extremely penetrating, even capable of seeping into non-fire elements, and accumulating over a long period.

Before long, one person and five Pet Beasts stopped outside the Poison Flame Valley.

The ground ahead carried a hint of an unusual crimson, clearly demarcated from what lay behind.

As Xu Ran took a step forward, he heard a "sizzle" sound.

The soles of his shoes that came into contact with the fire poison accumulated in the ground were instantly burned away a layer.

Withdrawing his foot quickly, Xu Ran’s face revealed a somewhat odd expression, "In such a place, there are actually more than a dozen Beast Kings active?"

"Chirp!" (It’s so hot, so hot!

Cancan, who had followed Xu Ran in taking a step, rapidly withdrew its paws and violently shook them in the air twice, baring its teeth and grimacing.

The fire poison itself didn’t pose much harm to it, but the sense of burning brought by the fire poison didn’t decrease in the slightest because of this.

"Loo roar~" (Let me try~)

The Firefly stepped forward briskly, its crimson eyes filled with an eagerness to try.

With each step it took, its paw pads lit up with crimson flames, contending against the fire poison hidden in the ground.

Being a Fire Pet Beast itself, it adapted extremely fast.

"Try using Fluid Fire Avoidance," Xu Ran reminded.

Fluid Fire Avoidance was a skill upgraded with a Three Star Skill Scroll during the last resource distribution the Firefly had received.

The skill originally was Fire Resisting, permitting the Firefly to be immune to fire attribute damage to a certain extent, but with the skill upgrade, an additional effect was added.

Fluid Fire Avoidance could dissipate fire attribute power within a certain range.

To the Firefly, which was of the fire attribute itself, this skill effect seemed somewhat superfluous.

After all, by dispelling the fire attribute power, it also affected itself, considered a typical case of winning by hurting oneself as well.

But at this moment, this effect happened to be of use.

"Loo roar~" (I’ll try it!)

With Xu Ran’s reminder sparking a light in its eyes, the Firefly suddenly clapped its paws together in front of its chest.

"Snap~"

Accompanied by a crisp sound, a pale red halo spread out from the Firefly as the center, in all directions, eventually forming a pale red hemispherical light film around a five-meter radius of the Firefly.

Within the light film, the crimson color of the ground noticeably faded.

It worked!

Indeed, despite being special, the fire poison was also a kind of fire attribute power!

Xu Ran’s heart leapt with joy as he quickly rushed into the range covered by the light film.

The other four little ones quickly followed, entering the light film and breathing in fresh air free from fire poison, they felt refreshed and invigorated.

With the trouble from the fire poison resolved, one person and five Pet Beasts swiftly moved towards the interior of the Poison Flame Valley.

The Heart Burning Poisonous Flame Marrow is a rather special resource.

It can be considered a crystal completely condensed from fire poison, containing the extreme power of fire poison.

This kind of resource is rare elsewhere, but in fire attribute areas containing fire poison, it is always produced over many years of accumulation.

According to the information Xu Ran obtained previously, the Poison Flame Valley had the possibility of discovering Heart Burning Poisonous Flame Marrow both on the outskirts and the deepest parts.

The deeper one went into the valley, the more intense the fire poison became, and the higher the probabilities of finding it.

As they delved deeper, one person and five Pet Beasts inevitably received attacks from Transcendent Beings within the valley, but at this moment they were still in the periphery, and the strength of the Transcendent Beings was not too strong, at most at the Leadership Stage.

No sooner had these Transcendent Beings shown themselves than they were expediently and crisply dealt with in a wave of combat, controlled by Lead Silk Vertical Soul, utilizing Heart Tide and sharingsensations with the twelve, they became ruthlessly efficient resource searchers, seeking out Heart Burning Poisonous Flame Marrow for the one person and five beasts.

The main tactic was to make full use of the resources at hand.

And as the number of Transcendent Beings under the control of the twelve grew, they indeed found some clues.

"Cheep~" (Over there might have Heart Burning Poisonous Flame Marrow!)

The twelve abruptly looked in a certain direction, excitedly speaking out.

"Oh?" Xu Ran followed the direction of the twelve’s gazes, "Let’s go take a look."

At the moment, their location was roughly on the outer fringes of Poison Flame Valley, where it was not uncommon to encounter creatures at General stage, but the main inhabitants were still the Transcendent Beings of Leadership Stage.@@novelbin@@

If they could find the Heart Burning Poisonous Flame Marrow here, it would mean that a single person along with five Pet Beasts would not need to venture into the deepest part of the Poison Flame Valley and risk running into the dozen or so King Stage creatures within.

Although not afraid, Xu Ran still preferred to avoid trouble when he could.

Of course, Ziyun was not quite as pleased.

It glanced at the location where Twelve had discovered the Heart Burning Poisonous Flame Marrow and then at the direction of the deeper parts of Poison Flame Valley, letting out a slight sigh, feeling that it had lost a good opportunity to showcase its strength.

Under Twelve’s guidance, one person and five Pet Beasts changed direction and soon came upon a natural cave set into the rock wall.

Outside the cave, a Transcendent Being with eyes devoid of life stood rigidly.

"Jiu~" (Your effort in finding resources has been successful, I’ll spare you this time~)

Twelve muttered, with a flash of light in its ocean-blue eyes.

At the next moment, the Transcendent Being of Leadership Stage regained the sparkle in its eyes, looked at the single person and five beasts with fear, and without hesitation, ran away with all its might.

Not bothering with the creature that had regained its freedom, Xu Ran and the five little ones set their sights on the dark cave nearby.

From within the cave, indeed, a thicker concentration of Fire Attribute Power flowed out.

"Jiu~" (I just controlled it to go inside and take a look, and there is indeed a piece of Heart Burning Poisonous Flame Marrow.)

Twelve actively spoke up and began explaining.

"Then there’s no mistake," Xu Ran took a deep breath, looked toward Yinghuo, "Let’s go, we’re going in."

"Luhou~" (Okay!)

Yinghuo nodded vigorously and, looking at the cave in front of it, its steps became somewhat heavier.

The cave was not very long, and after walking for about a few dozen meters, they arrived in a spacious chamber within the cave.

The thick Fire Poison enveloped the entire chamber, and even Yinghuo, who was using its Fluid Fire Avoidance Skill, found it somewhat strenuous to completely block it out.

In the center of this chamber, a thick red light illuminated the whole area.

It was a spring-like feature, inside which flowed a thick, magma-like red liquid.

Atop the magma, a dark red crystal floated quietly, as if it had just been separated out not long ago.

At a glance, Xu Ran recognized that this was the last Main Material needed for Yinghuo’s evolution.

Heart Burning Poisonous Flame Marrow.

"Yinghuo," Xu Ran took out the other Evolution Resources he had prepared, and then took another deep breath, "be careful when evolving."

"Luhou!" Yinghuo hugged these resources and nodded vigorously.

Its face was filled with anticipation, yet also etched with tension.

Evolution is something that every being longs for, but it is also fraught with danger.

Even though it had made all the preparations it could, Yinghuo still felt a bit of trepidation, having never evolved before.

Ziyun seemed to perceive Yinghuo’s mood and revealed a relaxed expression.

"Miaow~" (Relax, if I could succeed in evolving, you can too!)

Without a doubt, among the five little ones, Ziyun had faced the highest Difficulty in evolving from Leader to King Stage.

After all, it had to add an Attribute during evolution.

Upon hearing Ziyun’s comforting words, Yinghuo took a deep breath, its tension easing somewhat.

"Xi Lu~" (You can do it, cheer up.)

Starlet cried out sharply, offering its own comfort and encouragement.

Yinghuo looked up into those amethyst eyes, reminiscing about the initial exchange it had with Starlet at the breeding base.

Starlet, like Yinghuo, had faced similar circumstances and now had come this far.

Yinghuo firmly grasped its bear paw and swung it forcefully.

It definitely could do it too!

"Luhou!" (I’m off!)

Yinghuo looked at Xu Ran and the other four little ones, then walked towards the spring with the Evolution Materials in hand.

With a light stomp, the Heart Burning Poisonous Flame Marrow was swept up in a pillar of fire that rose skyward from the magma, landing in its palm.

Enveloped by an intense Fire Poison that reached its peak in an instant, Yinghuo’s paw felt the corrosive assault despite the damage reduction from its innate Fluid Fire Avoidance, and a pained expression appeared on its face.

Not daring to be careless, Yinghuo quickly swallowed the other materials one by one and then closed its hand around the Heart Burning Poisonous Flame Marrow, sitting cross-legged next to the hot spring gushing with heat.

A few breaths later, Yinghuo’s presence began to grow wild and unstable.

The Resources it had swallowed were starting to take effect.
