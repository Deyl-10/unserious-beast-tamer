Chapter 714 - 341: Kill The Exhibition In Advance!

```

The truth proved that Xu Ran’s expectations had been too idealistic.

Past midnight, Xu Ran, who had been in deep meditation, slowly opened his eyes, looking helplessly at the line of text that suddenly appeared before him.

[Joy Value Reminder: The pleasure value of the foster pet beast sweet bell has abnormally decreased]

Here it came.

The pleasure value had decreased abnormally again.

What was the situation this time?

Injured? Suddenly fell ill? Or something else?

Xu Ran immediately picked up the control hub that was on his bedside and started viewing the monitors.

In the surveillance footage, there sat a humanoid pet beast with a small and frail figure, and a bell larger than its body dangling from its head, quietly sitting in the deepest part of a cave, hugging its knees with a face pressed against them, void of any expression.

This... didn’t seem like it was feeling unwell, did it?

Xu Ran’s eyebrows slightly raised, a look of confusion appearing on his face.

But from the surveillance footage, there was no apparent problem.

He also checked the playback and still couldn’t find a reason for the abnormal decrease in the sweet bell’s pleasure value.

It seemed that he could only go to the scene in person to have a look.

He sat up from the bed, glancing around the empty room.@@novelbin@@

At this time, all five little ones had gone for training.

Throwing on a casual coat, Xu Ran left the room in his pajamas, quickly heading towards the foster area.

Before long, he had entered the cave shown in the surveillance footage and found the sweet bell inside.

The handheld night light emitted a hazy glow, illuminating the dark depths of the cave and the silhouette of the sweet bell.

Approaching the sweet bell, Xu Ran heard a series of faint sounds.

He cautiously drew closer and then discovered that the sweet bell was softly sobbing.

So, it was in a bad mood?

No wonder nothing was apparent from the surveillance.

Xu Ran suddenly nodded in understanding as the hexagram star array behind him flickered rapidly.

In the breeze, the figure of Wind materialized swiftly.

Under Xu Ran’s switch, it paused its training and appeared here.

With such commotion, naturally, the sweet bell could not have been unaware.

But its sobbing merely paused for a moment, then continued with its subdued weeping.

Having Wind as a translator, Xu Ran immediately felt a bit more confident.

He gently sat beside the sweet bell, softly asking, "So... is there something that’s made you unhappy?"

The sweet bell continued to hang its head in silence, though at this moment, the bell on its head shook slightly, emitting a clear ring.

"Bell~" (I don’t know myself, I just suddenly felt very sad.)

Suddenly felt very sad?

Xu Ran’s brows furrowed.

Was this some kind of late-night emo?

"Is there no specific reason for feeling down?"

The big bell atop the sweet bell’s head gently swayed once more.

"Bell~" (I’m unsure, I simply can’t pinpoint it.)

It seemed it indeed was late-night emo.

Xu Ran roughly concluded in his mind.

In life, there are always some displeasures, and these minor upsets can cause us slight unhappiness. If this unhappiness is suppressed for a long time without venting, it can erupt out of nowhere, turning into unexplained low spirits.

You would find it hard to say that this low mood is due to any specific cause, as all the displeasures experienced over a period could act as a trigger.

And such low moods tend to happen at night.

The solitude of the long night, when emotional outbursts are most unexpected.

"Wait for me here," Xu Ran gave Wind a look, signaling it to stay with the sweet bell, and then he left the cave.

Soon, he returned with a small food bowl in his hands.

The bowl contained an exquisite late-night snack he had prepared for the sweet bell, not only delicious but also had a soothing effect on the mood.

The effectiveness of the food was immediate. As he gently placed the bowl before the sweet bell, it raised its face for the first time, revealing features similar to those of humans, though now streaked with tears.

"Give it a try. Eating something tasty will make you feel better," Xu Ran smiled and made a "please taste" gesture.

The sweet bell hesitated for a moment, then nodded, taking the bowl and slowly starting to eat.

The enchanting flavors dispelled the cloud of gloom from its heart, and on Xu Ran’s pleasure value panel, the sweet bell’s pleasure value began to rise steadily.

However, the amount of late-night snacks in the bowl was quite limited, and it was quickly finished by the sweet bell, and as it set down the empty bowl, the pleasure value it provided began to drop again.

Xu Ran: "..."

This wasn’t working.

Food could temporarily lighten its mood, but this method was merely a stopgap solution. Unless he prepared a continual supply of tasty food for the sweet bell all night, which was clearly impossible.

Seeing the sweet bell about to bury its face in its knees again, Xu Ran hurriedly spoke up, "Is there anything you feel like doing right now?"

Since food wasn’t effective, they might as well try doing something else to distract the sweet bell.

The sweet bell paused for a moment, its eyes showing a pensive look before it shook its head gently, the large bell on its head jingling lightly.

"Bell~" (Right now, I don’t want to do anything, I just feel so uncomfortable.)

"This..." Seeing the sweet bell’s lack of interest, Xu Ran felt at a loss.

How to dispel such low spirits?

Wind stared at the silent sweet bell, as if seeing clumps of dark smoke enveloping it, and couldn’t help but speak out.

"Chirp?" (Shall I give it a try?)
