Chapter 778 - 369: First Visit To Broken Abyss City_2

By contrast, the safety of Beast Field No. 47 was of greater importance.

Therefore, after a brief negotiation with Fang Canghai, Xu Ran, who had just tasted the Yang Guang Cultivation Method, officially began his training in it.

Under the advice of Fang Canghai, for the next three days, Xu Ran did not meditate, and without the absorption of contract power, his own vital energy, Essence Force, and Divine Sense became more evenly distributed without changing the overall amount.

Although on the surface, Xu Ran’s own strength seemed to have weakened, he was well aware that beneath this façade of reduced vital energy lay an astonishing new power.

During a rest on the second day of his journey, he had, relying on his own power, struck a passing hill with his sword, splitting it in two from the middle with a single blow.

The Sky-Cleaving Six Sabers already originated from another world, and previously, when Xu Ran could only use his vital energy to perform swordsmanship, he was unable to fully unleash its true might.@@novelbin@@

With the replenishment of Essence Force and Divine Sense, this formidable sword technique now shone with new brilliance in his hands.

"Xu Ran, we have arrived,"

Fang Canghai’s voice rang out near his ear, and Xu Ran opened his eyes from his training.

Just as he was about to say something, when his gaze fell upon the vast city that occupied his entire field of vision and was on a scale he had never before seen, he couldn’t help but reveal an expression of utter astonishment.

Before this, the largest city Xu Ran had ever seen was none other than Xieyun City. As the undisputed first city of Beast Field No. 47, the scale and grandeur of Xieyun City had given Xu Ran a strong sense of awe the first time he saw it.

And now, the feeling that Broken Abyss City gave to Qin Chuan was that of a vast extent that should not exist in reality.

Broken Abyss City, situated in the sky.

It was a thousand times larger than Xieyun City in terrifying scale, and even from a significant distance, it almost completely occupied Xu Ran’s field of vision, stretching beyond where the eye could see.

At the base of Broken Abyss City, the inverted cone-shaped rock and soil foundation, like a divine peg pointed straight at the earth, enveloped in unfathomable power, pointed towards the abyss below.

This is where the name "Broken Abyss" originated from.

"Below Broken Abyss City lies the Corpse Abyss," apparently noticing the direction of Xu Ran’s gaze, Fang Canghai beside him spoke slowly, "This place is the most terrifying transcendent land of Beast Field No. 8."

"Unlike other transcendent lands, the Corpse Abyss was formed during a battle between us and the Transcendent Beings several hundred years ago."

"In that battle, both sides lost a total of seven beings of the Saint Rank."

"All seven of the Saint Rank fell on the battlefield. The immense power belonging to Saint Rank, coupled with the enmity they bore for each other, entangled together."

"Unlike ordinary Transcendent Beings, the power of the Holy Spirit Race lingers much longer after death due to undergoing an Attribute transition, staying for an extended period, and more easily affecting the surrounding area to form a transcendent land."

"Among the seven fallen Saint Spirits, one’s Attribute was associated with death. Its power interacted with the powers of the other Saint Ranks, affecting countless fallen Transcendent Beings on the battlefield, creating a perilous haunt."

"This is what we now see as the Corpse Abyss," as Fang Canghai said this, his complexion naturally grew more solemn, "The Corpse Abyss is bottomless, and within it lie who knows how many terrifying creatures that persist in another form after death."

"Even Semi-Saints who enter might be in danger of perishing."

"The relocation of Broken Abyss City over the Corpse Abyss has a very important purpose, which is to monitor the state of the Corpse Abyss at all times."

"We must never allow the beings within the Corpse Abyss to escape."

"I see," Qin Chuan revealed a look of realization.

As he looked again towards the unfathomable abyss that sent shivers down one’s spine, he faintly felt an illusion as if some terrifying existence below the abyss were also gazing back at him.

The land where seven Saint Spirits fell.

Just the thought was enough for him to feel an overwhelming pressure engulfing him,

And yet, Broken Abyss City has always kept a firm hold over this place and has built such a grand scale, showing its confidence in its own strength.

"Let’s go, let’s enter," he said, and by then, they had already arrived at the giant Floating Island where Broken Abyss City was located.

Unlike other cities, Broken Abyss City had no walls or gates.

Leaping down from the back of the jade-colored Giant Dragon and stepping onto the Floating Island, the turmoil in Xu Ran’s heart caused by Corpse Abyss instantly settled.

A sense of unprecedented peace and tranquility emerged within him.

An indistinct layer of light around the Floating Island completely sealed off the aura of Corpse Abyss, and all that approached was air carrying a hint of sweetness and a gentle, warm breeze.

"It’s quite magical, isn’t it?" Seeing Xu Ran’s increasingly astonished expression, Fang Canghai smiled nonchalantly, having forgotten that his first visit to Broken Abyss City was no better than Xu Ran’s, "Broken Abyss City is the capital of Shining Holy Kingdom."

"Within the borders of Shining Holy Kingdom, this is the ultimate sanctuary," Fang Canghai said, and stepped towards the depths of Broken Abyss City, "Let’s go, I’ll take you to see the true splendor of Broken Abyss City." Although surprised at the peculiar changes brought about by the encounter between the Yang Guang Cultivation Method and the Beast Master’s contract power, Xu Ran knew that now was not the time to delve into it.

By comparison, the safety of Beast Field No. 47 was more important.

Therefore, after brief negotiations with Fang Canghai, Xu Ran, who had just sampled the Yang Guang Cultivation Method, officially began his training in it.

Following Fang Canghai’s suggestion, for the next three days, Xu Ran did not meditate, and without the absorption of contract power, his own blood qi, Essence Force, and Divine Sense began to even out while their total volume remained unchanged.

Although superficially, Xu Ran’s own strength seemed weaker, he was well aware that beneath that façade of diminished blood qi, an astonishing new power lay hidden.

During a rest on the second day of the journey, he used his own strength to take a swing at a passing hill with his sword, slicing the hill in two right at its waist with a single strike.

The Sky-Cleaving Six Sabers, originating from another world, could not fully exert its true power when Xu Ran previously wielded swordsmanship with only blood qi.

With the replenishment of Essence Force and Divine Sense, this powerful swordsmanship now revealed a new brilliance in his hands.

"Xu Ran, we have arrived," Fang Canghai’s voice sounded next to his ear, and Xu Ran opened his eyes from his training.

He was about to say something when his gaze caught sight of the huge city that occupied his entire field of vision with its unprecedented grandeur, and he couldn’t help but reveal a look of utter astonishment.

Before this, the largest city Xu Ran had seen was none other than Xieyun City. As the undisputed first city of Beast Field No. 47, the first time Xu Ran beheld the grandeur and spectacle of Xieyun City, he felt a strong wave of awe.

At this moment, however, Broken Abyss City gave Qin Chuan the feeling of an immensity that should not exist in reality.

Broken Abyss City, located in the sky.

With a size a thousand times more terrifying than that of Xieyun City, even at a considerable distance, it almost completely dominated Xu Ran’s field of vision, endless at a glance.

At the bottom of Broken Abyss City, the inverted conical foundation of rock and soil looked like a divine nail pointing straight at the earth, encapsulating an unfathomable power, directed toward the abyss below.

The name "Broken Abyss" stems from this.

"Beneath Broken Abyss City lies Corpse Abyss," Fang Canghai said, noticing the direction of Xu Ran’s gaze, "This is the most terrifying Transcendent site in Beast Field No. 8."

"Unlike other Transcendent sites, Corpse Abyss was formed in a battle with Transcendent Beings hundreds of years ago."

"In that battle, both enemies and allies lost seven of the Saint Rank," Fang Canghai continued, "All seven Saint Rank perished on the battlefield, and the immense Power belonging to the Saint Rank, along with the hatred they harbored for each other before their demise, became intertwined."

"Unlike ordinary Transcendent Beings, the Power of the Holy Spirit Race, having gone through an Attribute transition, disperses more slowly upon their fall, lingers longer, and is more likely to influence its surroundings to form a Transcendent site."
