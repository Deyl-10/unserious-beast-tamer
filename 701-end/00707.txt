Chapter 712 - 340 Late Night Emo? What The Heck!_3

"This way, please," Xu Ran gestured towards the Washing and Protection room and then led the young girl inside.

"Wow~ What a large Washing and Protection room!"

Upon entering, the girl looked around in surprise, like a curious baby, looking around.

"Wait here for a moment." Unconcerned with the girl’s surprise, Xu Ran gently placed the Snowflake Rabbit on the grooming table for small Pet Beasts and then turned to prepare everything needed for its washing and protection.

Body wash, shampoo, hair conditioner...

All sorts of things required for washing and protection were quickly prepared by Xu Ran’s skilled hands, and soon after, he picked up the shower head filled with body wash and approached the Snowflake Rabbit.

The slightly cool body wash was sprayed evenly across the Snowflake Rabbit’s body, wetting the surface of its fine, long fur evenly. Xu Ran’s hands followed closely, carefully parting the long fur bit by bit, allowing the body wash to seep into the base of the fur.

Feeling the water envelop its body at a comfortable temperature, the massaging pressure around its body opened up its pores just right; the Snowflake Rabbit’s ice-blue eyes quickly clouded with confusion, a veil of mist covering its clear pupils.

Its petite body trembled lightly in Xu Ran’s maneuvering hands, an electrifying tingling feeling making it somewhat unable to control its own body.

The Snowflake Rabbit’s tripartite lips quivered, but no sound came out.

As the notifications of pleasure values appeared, a more pronounced smile spread across Xu Ran’s face. Once the fur of the Snowflake Rabbit was sufficiently drenched, he quickly poured the whipped shampoo down its back.

The sudden coolness flowing down its spine startled the cold-loving Snowflake Rabbit; the pleasant scent of the shampoo, along with the intensified massage from Xu Ran, gradually made its consciousness flit and flutter.

It felt its body becoming lighter and lighter, as if it could fly away at any moment.@@novelbin@@

The Snowflake Rabbit instinctively raised its head slightly, and the light from the Washing and Protection room’s bulbs dazzled it at that moment, sending it into a daze.

Its body’s trembles escalated, the quivering of its lips growing more pronounced, and a series of barely controllable heavy breaths became distinct and clear in the quiet Washing and Protection room.

Still not making a sound?

Glancing at the Snowflake Rabbit’s current state, Xu Ran decided to increase the pressure.

The patter of his massaging hands suddenly turned wild, like a gusty downpour, each massage transferring just the right amount of pressure precisely onto the Snowflake Rabbit’s body.

The Snowflake Rabbit’s gaze grew more vacant.

In that moment, it felt like a small boat on the crest of furious waves, ready to capsize at any second.

The intense tingling sensation across its body was overwhelming, impossible to suppress, yet irresistible—the satisfaction after the massage made the rabbit’s body shake even more violently.

The Snowflake Rabbit’s tripartite lips moved rapidly, and finally, a sound so faint it was barely audible yet undeniably real echoed within the Washing and Protection room.

"Mmm~~~"

The young girl sitting aside and watching Xu Ran’s grooming widened her eyes in disbelief at the sound.

What’s going on?!

How could her mute bride be speaking?!

-----------------

"Take care, welcome back again next time!"

Standing at the shop’s entrance, Xu Ran sent off the dazed-looking girl with a beaming smile.

She hadn’t yet recovered from the shock of her own Pet Beast making a sound.

Having contracted the Snowflake Rabbit for such a long time, she always thought it was mute!

Never did she imagine that the creature simply chose not to speak!

Watching the girl disappear into the crowd, Xu Ran withdrew his gaze and returned to the store.

Then, his expression suddenly changed.

A line of text appeared in front of his eyes.

[Only 2,600 left, working hard to burst out content]

You should know, no Foster Shop in so many incarnation experiences has ever achieved full marks! Even the Pingtian Foster Shop has a considerable gap from the full marks!

If a new Foster Shop manages to get full marks so easily, the evaluators might be accused of going easy on them.

"Don’t panic." Another lead evaluator remained quite calm, "The evaluation of foster experiences isn’t limited to just two dimensions."

"Besides ’eating’ and ’staying’, there’s another aspect: emergency situations that may arise during fostering."

"We’ve made quite a few arrangements for such emergencies."

"I don’t believe Starfire Foster Care Shop can handle emergency situations flawlessly."

"They will definitely encounter unresolved troubles!"

Light dawned on the other evaluators upon hearing this lead evaluator’s words.

Yes, there are emergency situations!

Due to Starfire Foster’s outstanding performance so far, they almost forgot about this.

Emergency situations can be considered the grand finale of foster experience challenges, and it’s also the most problematic point in pet beast fostering.

The most important reason is that emergencies happen randomly.

In the "staying" part of foster experiences, it only requires setting up a suitable living environment for the Pet Beast from the beginning, and there won’t be much trouble afterwards.

"Eating" on the other hand, requires understanding the different dietary habits of Pet Beasts and consistently feeding at regular times to ensure no issues arise.

Both of these caregiving methods are regular.
