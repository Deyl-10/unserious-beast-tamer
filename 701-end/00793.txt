Chapter 797 - 380: Battle, Feather Dragon Crown Prince!

"Outrageous humans!"

After Fang Canghai’s challenge echoed for a brief few breaths, a voice transmitted from the army of Transcendent Beings within Beast Field number eight. One after another, the Beast Emperors rose into the air, appearing in front of Fang Canghai, with as many as seventeen in total.

The leading Beast Emperor was none other than the one that had dealt with Ji Xuan before, known as the Xuanlong Beast Emperor. Unlike its submissive tone with Ji Xuan, at this moment, facing an equally matched opponent like Fang Canghai, it displayed its own dignity and arrogance.

"Even the Emperor Level Beast Master from Broken Abyss City wouldn’t dare to be so presumptuous in front of us!" the Xuanlong Beast Emperor growled lowly, scanning the opponents from Fang Canghai’s side.

Its gaze lingered a moment longer on the figure draped in a black robe, a trace of puzzlement emerging in its eyes because to its perception, the opponent seemed void of any strength, like an ordinary human.

However, it quickly dismissed this doubt, baring its teeth and mercilessly sneering, "Humans, is this all the strength Beast Field number 47 has?"

"Where are the Beast Emperors that once submitted to the Semi-Saint Demon Wood? Have they disappeared like their master?"

"Sharp-tongued." The figure in the black robe spoke in a low voice. Before the Xuanlong Beast Emperor could react, the figure had already flashed before it.

The Xuanlong Beast Emperor’s pupils contracted slightly, it hadn’t even seen the opponent make a move, and the next instant, it felt a pain in its body as its massive form was blasted towards the ground like a cannonball, crashing into its own ranks, stirring up a great cloud of blood mist and dust.@@novelbin@@

The entire battlefield fell silent at this sudden turn of events.

Suddenly swirling its wings to disperse the dust, the Xuanlong Beast Emperor burst out of the ground and flashed back to its original position, its dragon scales marked with cracks and blood, no longer composed, staring intently at the black robe.

"Who are you?!"

The other Beast Emperors from the same camp as the Xuanlong Beast Emperor also changed their expressions at this moment.

For the Xuanlong Beast Emperor to be the leader among the present Beast Emperors, it relied on absolute strength. Yet now, it was so easily blasted away, without even the ability to block?

Who exactly was that person?

Could it be...

One of the Beast Emperors suddenly gasped, as if realizing something, and spoke in a grave voice, "Ji Xuan, do you think you can so brazenly ignore the rule that a Semi-Saint cannot enter the fray just by hiding your identity?"

Upon hearing this, Fang Canghai’s mouth twitched slightly.

Ji Xuan...

Indeed, the other had come to the scene.

However, Ji Xuan had not made a move, merely observing the battle from another location.

One wondered how Ji Xuan would react to such questioning?

The next moment, Fang Canghai knew.

A blade light flashed from afar, slicing the Beast Emperor who had spoken into two, while Ji Xuan’s indifferent voice came from the other side, "Speaking my name so disrespectfully, you shall be executed."

On another mountain peak, Ji Xuan’s figure emerged.

He did not continue his attack; hands behind his back, he simply watched quietly as if his previous move was just for punishing the disrespect.

Seeing this scene, the expressions of the Beast Emperors from Beast Field number eight were exceedingly ugly.

They didn’t pity the fool who had just courted death. Knowing that Ji Xuan had not left Beast Field number 47 and still daring to speak so boldly, his death was a waste.

What they truly cared about was that the figure in the black robe was not Ji Xuan.

This meant that the battle had taken on some unexpected turns!

"You... who exactly are you?" The Xuanlong Beast Emperor shifted its gaze from Ji Xuan, staring intensely at the black robe, its eyes filled with seriousness.

It still could not sense any trace of the opponent’s presence.

But the fact that the opponent had instantly blasted it away earlier was certainly not a dream!

This could only mean one thing.

It meant that the opponent was much stronger than it.

"Who am I?" The figure in the black robe chuckled with a hint of mockery, "You come for me, yet you do not know who I am?"

As it spoke, the figure’s hood was lifted to reveal a wooden-faced treant underneath the black robe.

An imposing aura surged from its body, washing over every Beast Emperor from Beast Field number eight like a massive wave.

A spear, covered in leaf patterns, emerged in its hand. Grasping the spear firmly, the treant’s eyes narrowed, and in the next instant, it appeared before the Xuanlong Beast Emperor.

"It’s you?!" The heart of the Xuanlong Beast Emperor filled with alarm, it uttered a roar of shock and rage, "The Semi-Saint Demon Wood?!"

It hadn’t been able to react to the previous strike, completely caught off guard by the opponent’s strength, but now that it was being approached again, the Xuanlong Beast Emperor naturally wouldn’t sit idle.

Its dragon scales glowed fiercely, its body rapidly surging with power, its claws shining with a sharp chill as it harshly grasped towards the incoming spear.

"BOOM!!!"

Warding off an attack and flying back dozens of meters, the Xuanlong Beast Emperor was not startled but pleased, because at the moment of the collision, it had finally felt the opponent’s strength.

The Earth attribute power sparked many connections in its mind.

"It’s you indeed!"

As the Xuanlong Beast Emperor called out the origin of the Semi-Saint Demon Wood, the other Beast Emperors simultaneously turned pale.

"What are you waiting for?" The deputy to the Xuanlong Beast Emperor, another Beast Emperor, roared, "Attack together!"

Although their primary mission in coming here was to raze Beast Field number 47 to the ground to showcase their domain’s might.

But with the reappearance of the Semi-Saint Demon Wood, they naturally had to adapt their mission.

Everyone knew that capturing the Semi-Saint Demon Wood was even more crucial than leveling Beast Field number 47.

The other fourteen Beast Emperors said nothing and immediately attacked the Semi-Saint Demon Wood from all directions, attempting to encircle and annihilate him.
