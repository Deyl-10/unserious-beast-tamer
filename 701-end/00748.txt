Chapter 664: Chapter 328: Thunder Starts_3

As Ziyun had described, the process was very similar to the display of Extinct Thunder Attraction, with the only difference being that the triggered Thunder Strike effect was not as terrifying as that of Extinct Thunder Attraction.

“Is that so…” After listening to Ziyun’s description, Xu Ran stroked his chin, showing a thoughtful expression.

A moment later, his eyes grew brighter.

“It seems that this skill is indeed a good omen,” Xu Ran’s smile thickened on his face, “I have a bold idea, and if it can be realized, our chances of securing the Extinct Thunder Attraction will increase by quite a bit.”@@novelbin@@

“Meow?” (What idea?)

Ziyun asked curiously.

“We’ll talk about that later,” Xu Ran said with a mysterious smile, “Let’s continue with the resource allocation.”

“Now all your skills have been upgraded to Four Stars, and the post-upgrade skills also meet the Evolution Conditions, the only thing left is Skill Proficiency.”

“Meow~” (Exchange for Skill Points!)

Ziyun said without hesitation.

Its Main Material for Evolution is now only the Extinct Thunder Attraction, and in other areas, there is no room for improvement for the moment. The only thing it can do now is to upgrade the remaining three Talent Skills to Violent Sun Level.

In doing so, by meeting the full skill requirement of Four Stars and all skills at Violent Sun Level, it would reach a truly invincible state at the General Stage.

“Good.” Xu Ran nodded and quickly started allocating points.

Ziyun had not been idle in the past half month, its Skill Proficiency had been rapidly increasing. Therefore, after spending over ten thousand Skill Points, it reached its goal of having all skills at Violent Sun Level.

“Meow!” (I have finished!)

Feeling the surge of immense power within its body, Ziyun declared the end of its exchange with satisfaction.

The next time resources were allocated, its evolution would likely be complete without any surprise, and its priority for exchange would disappear.

It was time to give the opportunity to other teammates.

“Xi Lu~” (Is it my turn?)

Star cried out in excitement.

Its gaze immediately fell upon the words “Four Star Skill Scrolls” on Little Black’s board.

Ziyun had its own plan for its last skill, so it did not use this item. Thus, the best user for this item was naturally Star.

And Star indeed had a use for the Four Star Skill Scroll.

“Xi Lu~” (Use the Four Stars Skill Scroll on the Night Rune!)

Star said without hesitation.

In choosing this skill, it had its own considerations as well.

Firstly, Star had not yet found any skills suitable to merge with this one, so directly using a Four Star Skill Scroll to upgrade would not be a waste.

Secondly, and most importantly,

The battle for the Extinct Thunder Attraction could come at any time, and it would certainly be brutal.

By upgrading this skill to Four Stars, it would help the team even better.

“Meow~” (Thank you~)

Ziyun looked deeply at Star, instantly understanding its intent.

Xu Ran, who also understood Star’s intention, smiled slightly and used the Four Star Skill Scroll.

Dazzling red light accompanied the disappearance of the Night Rune on Star’s panel, and in its place, a whole new skill appeared.

[★★★ Night Rune (Violent Sun Level)]

↓↓↓

[★★★★ Star God Blessing (Violent Sun Level)]

“Hmm?” Xu Ran’s face showed a few hints of surprise as he looked at the new skill, “Is there a surprise?”

Besides needing all Talent Skills upgraded to Four Stars, Star’s Evolution Conditions required at least three post-upgrade skills to be linked with Star Power.

After discussions between Xu Ran and Star, they concluded that although the Evolution Conditions required three, having more skills connected with Star Power could be helpful for the final evolution.

The Night Rune was a pure Dark Skill, and it was not related to Star Power in itself.

Xu Ran thought that directly using the Four Star Skill Scroll to upgrade the skill would result in a new Four Star Skill that would not be associated with Star Power.

But to his surprise, there was such a delightful twist.

“What’s the effect of this new skill?” Xu Ran couldn’t help but ask aloud as he watched Star recover from its daze.

Star didn’t answer.

Or rather, it gave an answer with its actions.

In an instant, dazzling starlight appeared beneath the feet of Xu Ran and the other four pets, weaving mysterious patterns in the void and transforming into an unbreakable protective force.

The aura of the man and his four pets began to climb with each breath.

The original Night Rune already provided a significant boost in strength, but now the Star God Blessing’s increase was even more terrifying.

Even Cancan, who had reached the King Stage, felt his power had almost doubled under the boost of Star God Blessing.

However, a powerful skill was bound to have equally significant consumption.

After casting it for a short while, Star had to dissipate the power of Star God Blessing.

Its aura had become noticeably weaker than before, a rare sight for Star which was almost endlessly energetic.

After quickly casting Prayer of Starry Night, Star soon replenished its consumed power, but its face still showed a trace of lingering fear.

“It seems that although this skill is strong, we can’t fully deploy it for the time being,” Xu Ran nodded slightly, understanding the situation, “This might also be related to Cancan. Using a General Level to boost a King Stage surely requires significant energy.”

“Star, try excluding Cancan and boosting the rest of us.”
