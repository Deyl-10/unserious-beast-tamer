Chapter 780 - 370: Between The Saint Spirits_2

-----------------

At the same time, on the streets of Broken Abyss City, a luxurious carriage sped by, sporting a golden emblem that was particularly striking, prompting all passersby who saw the emblem to proactively get out of the way.

This symbol represented the royal family of the Shining Holy Kingdom.

Inside the carriage, Ailan looked at her brother, who sat upright and proper, her brow slightly furrowed, "What were you just talking with that man about? You almost came to blows."

"No, we didn’t!" Aike was taken aback that his sister hadn’t dropped the matter completely, and after a brief moment of surprise, he repeatedly protested his innocence, "How could it possibly come to that?"

"How could it not?" Ailan’s frown deepened, "Try to hide it again and see what happens."

She thought about the faint sense of danger she had distinctly felt emanating from that man before she had intervened.

If she had intervened a moment later, who knows what would have happened.

Hearing his sister say this, Aike knew that Ailan must have noticed something, and his expression turned helpless, "I was just…"

Aike gave a brief account of the incident.

Of course, in his recounting, he embellished and flattered himself a bit.

Ailan glanced at Aike but did not expose this point.

She had already roughly pieced together what had happened.

"Aike…" Ailan looked at her fourteenth brother with a complex expression, "Is there ever a time you leave the palace without causing trouble?"

"I…" Aike was at a loss for words.

"Enough, reflect on yourself." Ailan waved her hand and then turned to a guard who appeared in the carriage at some point, "Have you found out everything?"

"Reporting to Princess Ailan, the person comes from Beast Field number 47, following Fang Canghai, the President of the Beast Master Association of Xieyun City," the guard said respectfully.

As the guard spoke, Aike, who had been sitting obediently, perked up his ears.

"Beast Field number 47…" A thought flashed through Ailan’s eyes, and suddenly recalling something made it clear to her, "Okay, I understand."

"Sis, can I…" Aike began, his face full of anticipation, about to say something, but Ailan cut him off before he could speak.

"You can’t." Ailan interrupted without hesitation, glaring sternly at Aike, "You want to go to Beast Field number 47?"

She knew her brother all too well.

This guy, once he set his mind on something, not even ten bulls could pull him back.

At the moment, Aike was interested in the pet beast of that Beast Master and didn’t believe what the other party had said; clearly, he was planning to go to Beast Field number 47 to see if he could find a horse-type pet beast that was exactly the same.

"I won’t go." Aike shrank back, flashing a flattering smile, "I’ll send a couple of powerful subordinates to find me a pet beast."

"Hey, sis~"

Seeing that Ailan remained silent, Aike quickly moved forward to embrace her arm.

"This is non-negotiable," Ailan said coldly, withdrawing her hand, "Beast Field number 47 is in the midst of troubled times; your people going there will only cause more trouble."

"...Ah?" Hearing this, Aike blinked, "What’s with Beast Field number 47?"

Entirely inattentive to political affairs, he knew only the most superficial things about the current situation in Beast Field number 8, and he was completely clueless about Beast Field number 47.

"In Beast Field number 47, a Semi-Saint has emerged," said Ailan slowly.

"Doesn’t that mean Beast Field number 47 is finished?" Aike exclaimed in shock, quickly responding, "Shouldn’t we send an Epic Level Beast Master to help or something?" Explore more at empire

"Help with what?"

"To kill that Semi-Saint," Aike said as if it were obvious, "Otherwise, won’t the humans in Beast Field number 47 be wiped out?"

"You truly don’t care about the situation at all," Ailan said with a look of disbelief, "I discussed this with your second and third brothers the other day; you were right there. It seems you didn’t listen to a word we said."

"Ugh, that… when you guys talk politics, it makes me want to sleep," said Aike, both embarrassed and defiant.

Ailan shook her head in exasperation at her hopeless brother.

"The newly arisen Semi-Saint in Beast Field No. 47 is neutral; it seems to want to foster harmonious relations between humans and transcendental beings and had made several attempts to do so before becoming a Semi-Saint,"

"So, the situation isn’t what you think it is,"

"Humans living in harmony with transcendental beings..." Aike blinked, "Isn’t that the very ideal that the Loxen Holy Spirit has always insisted upon?"

"Yes," Ailan nodded slightly, her expression softening a bit.

She had just felt that her brother was starting to think, but upon hearing Aike’s next words, her face darkened once again.

"Then that’s great news for Beast Field No. 47!" Aike spoke with a puzzled look, "With an additional Semi-Saint advocating for harmony between humans and transcendental beings, that place is bound to become even more peaceful."

"It’s not that simple," Ailan shook her head with a sigh, "Beast Field No. 47 isn’t isolated from the world. Haven’t you thought about what impact the Beast Saints of Beast Field No. 8 and our side’s Saint Spirits might have on this?"

"Tell me, which of our Saint Spirits do the Saints despise the most?"

"Uh..." Aike blinked, "The Loxen Holy Spirit?"

"Correct," Ailan spoke solemnly, "Although the Loxen Holy Spirit advocates for harmony between humans and transcendental beings, its methods are quite aggressive and not very meticulous."

"Among all the Saint Spirits, it is the only one that repeatedly attacks powerless transcendental beings without regard for its reputation."

"Several minor transcendental species within the Beast Field who hold extreme hatred for humans have been annihilated by the Loxen Holy Spirit."

"And for this reason, the Loxen Holy Spirit is the most disliked by the Saints of the Beast Field, and even a few Beast Saints who are somewhat favorable towards humans express extreme dissatisfaction when it comes to the Loxen Holy Spirit."

At this point, Ailan’s expression carried a hint of helplessness.

Admittedly, although the Loxen Holy Spirit’s style and methods are particularly forceful, its actions have indeed brought significant deterrence to Beast Field No. 8.

At least now, there are few species in the Beast Field daring to openly claim they want to exterminate humans.

"That Semi-Saint from Beast Field No. 47 is facing scrutiny because its views are very close to those of the Loxen Holy Spirit, which has caught the attention of the Saints of the Beast Field," Ailan returned to the main topic, "They fear the emergence of a second Loxen Holy Spirit."

"So, they’ve decided to send several Semi-Saints to descend upon Beast Field No. 47, and even if they don’t kill the other party, they want to bring it back to Beast Field No. 8 to keep an eye on it directly."

"That Semi-Saint from Beast Field No. 47 is really wronged," Aike couldn’t help gritting his teeth, "It did nothing, yet it’s being targeted because of the Loxen Holy Spirit."

"Wronged?" Ailan’s eyes took on a strange look, "Not necessarily."

"A few days ago, the emissaries sent by the Saints of the Beast Field were slain by that being."

"That mysterious Semi-Saint, its personality does have some similarities to the Loxen Holy Spirit."@@novelbin@@

"Ah?" Aike’s mouth twitched slightly.

The emissaries were killed?

"I’m starting to understand why my sister said that Beast Field No. 47 is in troubled times," Aike shook his head with resignation, "Alright, then I won’t send people over."

"But there is one thing I still don’t understand," he looked puzzled, "Aren’t we going to send help?"

"We can’t help," Ailan’s eyes dimmed, "You should know where the Loxen Holy Spirit is right now."

"Uh... it should be at the eastern battlefield, right?" Aike thought for a moment and then answered, "It’s being tied down by several Beast Saints."

"Yes," Ailan turned her head, looking in a certain direction through the thick curtain of the carriage, "Those who detest the Loxen Holy Spirit aren’t limited to just the Saints within Beast Field No. 8."

"Among our human Saint Spirits, there are quite a few who don’t want to see the emergence of a second Loxen Holy Spirit."

"Sister, you mean..." Aike’s eyes widened, about to say something, but he was stopped by Ailan’s stern gaze.
