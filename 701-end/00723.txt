Chapter 728 - 346: Trace Of The Star Town_4

A few bats were swallowed up in the moment when Thunder Punishment erupted, but the vast majority of the bats escaped unscathed, regrouping elsewhere and returning to the form of the Ghost Bats.

Their momentum dropped slightly, but the Ghost Bats didn’t take much damage from that last strike, their blood-red eyes filled with a mix of shock and suspicion, clearly not having expected Ziyun’s skills to be so terrifying.

Without any regard for the reaction of the Ghost Bats, and with the first blow failing, Ziyun immediately turned her gaze to the side, toward the Dark Demon Lion that was rapidly pouncing toward her, its body enveloped in surging dark flames.

"Roar——"

With a fierce roar, the Dark Demon Lion quickly spewed out the dark flames it had been storing up in its mouth. The dark flames, like heavy artillery, enveloped Ziyun’s body, with the deep black light completely swallowing her.

-----------------

"Boom!!!"

Almost simultaneously as the black light swallowed Ziyun’s body, a thunderous sound came from behind.

The silent Ink Scale Leopard didn’t target Ziyun first for its attack; from the beginning of the battle, it had locked its gaze on the remaining human and four beasts.

At this moment, as the thunderous sound echoed, streaks of starlight interwoven into light patterns rapidly faded, and the rock wall rising from the ground crumbled inch by inch, unable to even repair itself.

The combined defense powers of Star and Cancan could barely withstand the Ink Scale Leopard’s assault.

"Chah!!"

With indignation and anger mixing together, Cancan suddenly lifted a claw, the light halo within it, like a grindstone, interweaving and descending toward the direction of the Ink Scale Leopard with force.

The patterns of starlight woven together converged onto its body, and under the effect of Star God Blessing, Cancan’s momentum rose with the falling of its enormous paw.

At this moment, Cancan was unspeakably troubled.

The abyss only just barely accommodated its original body size, which meant Cancan couldn’t use Heaven-Earth Law to maximize its size. It even had to shrink its body slightly, otherwise its movements would be greatly restricted at the bottom of the abyss.

For Cancan, whose strength hadn’t yet reached the complete King Stage, confronting the Ink Scale Leopard head-on was extremely difficult.

Watching the giant paw fall, a hint of gravity flashed in the red eyes of the Ink Scale Leopard; it could feel the power that was enough to threaten its own existence.

The dark mist between its paws became denser, nearly covering its limbs completely, as the Ink Scale Leopard turned into a shadowy figure, swiftly dodging to the side.

Two cold saber lights fell from the sky, working in conjunction with Cancan’s giant paw to try to seal off the Ink Scale Leopard’s range of motion.

The next instant, an inexplicable sense of drowsiness surged, causing the Ink Scale Leopard’s body to stiffen.

-----------------

"Zzzt——"

A sharp sound of electric light pierced the void, and Ziyun, who had been completely engulfed by the Dark Demon Lion’s full-blown attack, appeared unharmed in another part of the void. She immediately looked back, casting an anxious and worried glance in the direction of the human and four beasts.

"Worry about yourself a bit more!"

Accompanied by a taunting laugh filled with mockery, a series of dark blades appeared alongside the flapping wings of the Ghost Bats, shooting densely from the void and instantly enveloping all the space Ziyun could dodge to, like a curtain of rain.

The very void twisted minutely under these blades, with a terrifying momentum that seemed to engulf everything.

"Meow!" (The one who should be worried is you!)

Ziyun retorted unapologetically, the thunderbolt pattern on her forehead instantly bursting forth with dazzling brilliance.

Countless serpent-like tendrils of lightning appeared abruptly around Ziyun and headed toward the dark blades. Accompanied by the intermittent sounds of thunder, they quickly devoured the dark blades and then, without losing momentum, counterattacked.

Four Stars skill, Violent Sun Level・Thunder Shocker!

With one strike, Ziyun didn’t even look at the result and swung a claw back at the Dark Demon Lion who was preparing to ambush her, its lethal claws colliding heavily with hers.

A giant "Punishment" character interwoven with thunder patterns appeared in the void, the surging dark flames sweeping up around it, reflecting its light. The powers of the Thunder and Dark Attributes clashed against each other, eventually shattering into myriad fragments, swirling in the raging storm and scattering in all directions.

"Boom!!!"

Accompanied by a deep roar, the Dark Demon Lion’s body was thrown backward, crashing heavily against the rock wall, its claw that had collided with Ziyun oozing blood profusely, bones chillingly white, as thunder light flickered continuously.

Ziyun shook its paw, its figure flashed, and before the Dark Demon Lion could react, it had already appeared in front of it.@@novelbin@@

Ziyun raised its paw to grasp, and a thick deep purple thunderbolt descended from the void, turning into a terrifying thunder spear, plunging fiercely into the Dark Demon Lion’s abdomen, nailing it to the rock wall.

Four Stars Skill, Violent Sun Level - Astonishing Thunder Fury!

"Roar—"

The Dark Demon Lion let out a miserable scream, its entire body convulsing violently due to the rampaging invasion of the Thunderforce, a burnt smell wafting from the punctured abdomen, the instantaneous severe injury causing it to lose its combat abilities in the blink of an eye.

One down.

Ziyun’s figure flashed again, already in front of the equally distressed Ghost Bat.

The wide-range damage from the Thunder Shocker made it wary to disperse and dodge as it had before the Thunder Punishment; with no choice, it had to endure with other means.

With this strike, its aura visibly wilted, its body covered in wandering lightning, occasionally twitching, clearly heavily injured.

"Spare my life!" Seeing the Dark Demon Lion nailed to the rock wall, the Ghost Bat was terrified to its core. It hissed a plea, but Ziyun pretended not to hear.

Spare life?

If I let go of this guy now, who knows if it will sneak attack us in the mist when we leave the abyss.

Hence, the Ghost Bat must not be spared!

In the midst of repeated phasing and flashing, the Cloud Break Sky, already charged to the extreme, was now cast by Ziyun with a wave of its paw, becoming the final blow that put an end to the Ghost Bat.

With one strike, only a small section of bat wing bone radiating black light remained in the void.

Casually grabbing the Bat Wing Bone, Ziyun returned to the Dark Demon Lion, pulled out the thunder spear that nailed it, then grabbed the half-dead Dark Demon Lion and flung it toward Xu Ran and the other four little ones.

Just as Ziyun’s battle came to a close, the fight involving one human and four pets also reached its conclusion.

Under the forced disturbance of Endless Sleep, the Ink Scale Leopard lost its sole chance to get away unscathed. At the moment of life and death, it had to choose between being smashed by a paw or getting severely wounded by a blade, and it opted for the latter.

By enduring Xu Ran’s slashing blade, the Ink Scale Leopard managed to escape from the ready-to-strike Land of Destruction.

That slash also left a deep, bone-exposing injury on its body, its blood flowing profusely like money was no object, making the Ink Scale Leopard’s momentum plummet, its walking unsteady.

The returning Ziyun lifted its paw and gave the Ink Scale Leopard a hefty taunt, further exacerbating its already severe injuries, then dragged it and the Dark Demon Lion in front of Xu Ran like dragging dead dogs.

"I ask, you answer," Xu Ran spoke slowly, "Answer correctly, and I might let you live. Answer wrongly, and your lives end here."

The recently awakened Dark Demon Lion, weakly breathing, exchanged a glance with the Ink Scale Leopard before growling weakly, "Human, what do you want to know?"

"Do you know about the Town Star Stone?"

"We know," the Dark Demon Lion replied, its gaze flickering slightly.

A glint of deep light passed through the red eyes of the Ink Scale Leopard as it nodded swiftly.

Excitement surfaced in Star’s eyes, eager to continue the interrogation, but Xu Ran raised his hand to stop it.

"Make them tell separately. If their stories differ, kill them all."

Having said that, Xu Ran crossed his arms and looked at both the lion and the leopard.

These two creatures, very cunning.

At his words, the expressions of the lion and the leopard changed rapidly.

Ziyun and Cancan each took one away, and soon squeezed out the specifics, which, upon comparison, were nearly identical.
