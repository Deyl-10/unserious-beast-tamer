Chapter 738 - 349 Main Task 4 Completed, A-Grade System Skill!_2

And then, they came across a surprise revelation that was late to the scene.

The Starfire Foster Care Shop, which had forced numerous other foster shops to drop out of the competition with its unparalleled services, suddenly became known by countless people.

The line of customers already filled the space in front of the shop, and now it grew even more.

The fame of Starfire Foster Care Shop thus quietly exceeded 50%.

On the evening of the day Xu Ran received the first-place medal, a line of text appeared before his eyes after closing the shop.

[Main task 4 has been completed]

Upon seeing these words, Xu Ran immediately opened the task page.

[Main Task 4: Branch Out (Completed)]

Task description: The Host must successfully establish branches in four different Second Level Towns, with the fame of each branch reaching over 50% to be considered a success. This task is a staged task, with rewards distributed in stages.

Task reward: System Skill Upgrade Command x1, System Upgrade Experience +600]

[Current Stage Task: Successfully establish branches in four different Second Level Towns.]

[Claim Task Reward]

Here it comes!

Not only was the stage task completed, but with the fame of Xieyun, Monster Wooden, Bright Radiance, and Xuanxing in the Second Level Towns reaching 50%, Main Task 4 was thoroughly completed.

Xu Ran took a deep breath and didn’t hesitate to click on claim.

Inside the shop with its doors firmly closed, accompanied by the sudden appearance of a portal, three brand-new System Clerks appeared one after another.

The clerks were as irreverent as ever, but Xu Ran was now able to quickly compose himself. After briefly understanding the personalities and specialties of the three, he ultimately chose the one most suited to be promoted to store manager.

With the System Clerk deployment completed in Xuanxing City, this meant that he no longer needed to tirelessly mind the shop every day; he could take it easy and do other things in secret.

After settling the three System Clerks, Xu Ran looked back at the task panel. With the rewards for Main Task 4 claimed, a new main task had already appeared.

[Main Task 5: Sharpen Your Axe Without Delaying the Work of Cutting Firewood] Your next journey awaits at empire

Beast Field No. 47 is about to face an unprecedented disaster, one that will envelop all cities within, affecting the normal operations of more than half of the Host’s stores—something both the system and the Host cannot tolerate.

The Host is requested to assist the human forces within Beast Field No. 47, to achieve victory in this battle. As the saying goes, "sharpen your axe without delaying the work of cutting firewood." Only with a stable and peaceful environment can the Host conduct business more successfully.

Task reward: System Skill Upgrade Command x2, System Clerk Direct Purchase Rights, System Upgrade Experience +700]

Is this how the saying goes?

Xu Ran couldn’t help but scoff internally, while also being surprised by the particularity of this new task.

It was actually asking him to assist in achieving victory over the calamity.

As for the disaster mentioned by the system, Xu Ran already had a guess.

If things went as expected, the calamity originated from Beast Field No. 8, starting with the successful evolution of the Demon Wood Semi-Saint.

This thought added a few more layers of pressure to Xu Ran’s heart.@@novelbin@@

But, seeing the generous task rewards, he felt he was up to the task.

The completion of Main Task 4 had brought him a System Skill Upgrade Command, and with two more on the way, it meant he could elevate all system skills to B Level.

Beyond that, having the right to directly purchase System Clerks was also significant.

It meant Xu Ran no longer needed to acquire System Clerks through tasks, but could purchase them directly, staffing each branch immediately upon establishment.

The significance of this was self-evident.

After completing Main Task 4, the System Upgrade Experience had already reached 1300/2000, meaning the completion of Main Task 5 would bring another system upgrade.

With the last system upgrade, the service range at Starfire Foster Care Shop had greatly improved, and the capacity for attending to Pet Beasts increased from Leadership Stage to King Stage.

After this system upgrade, it was without a doubt that Starfire Foster Care Shop’s capacity would be further enhanced, with all services upgraded as well.

The future looked promising.

Closing the task panel, Xu Ran held the newly obtained System Skill Upgrade Command and opened his personal panel.

After selecting the System Skill Upgrade Command, Xu Ran looked at the three system skills and three different lines of text appeared before him.

Looking at the descriptions, Xu Ran fell into contemplation.
