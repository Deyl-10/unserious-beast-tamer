Chapter 707 - 339: The Tricky Organizers And The Flawless Boss Xu_2

As soon as Xu Ran lightly placed the food bowl down, the Red Brocade Bird swooped in, its long neck bending low to take a big bite from the bowl.

With the food entering its mouth, an intensely rich aroma instantly burst forth around the beak and nostrils of the Red Brocade Bird. This fragrance was mixed with a variety of complex Transcendent Resources, each one a flavor adored by the Red Brocade Bird!

Surprise and satisfaction gleamed in the eyes of the Red Brocade Bird. After savoring it briefly, it lifted its drooping neck high, allowing the food to slide down its slender neck into its stomach under the force of gravity.

After one bite, when the Red Brocade Bird looked back at the food bowl, its eyes were already filled with an unmistakable greed.

Mine! All mine!

It ate bite after bite, quickly finishing the not-so-abundant portion of food in the bowl.

Before long, the Red Brocade Bird carefully picked up the last piece of food residue in the corner of the bowl and swallowed it elegantly as a fitting end to the meal.

Seeing the large amount of Pleasure value provided by the Red Brocade Bird during its feeding, Xu Ran nodded contentedly.

With the prompt of Pleasure value, this foster experience seemed nearly like cheating.

After all, he could ascertain the real foster status of the Pet Beast at the moment through the earnings in Pleasure value.

"The food is very nutritious, just right for expending some energy after eating," Xu Ran said, cleaning up the food bowl and smiling slightly at the Red Brocade Bird that was pulsing with surging power, "I’ll be going now. Just call me if you need anything."

"Lii~" (Okay!)

The Red Brocade Bird nodded vigorously.

It also belatedly realized that its body had become hot and bothered, the vast amount of power absorbed from the food putting it in an overly energetic state, which was quite uncomfortable to contain at the moment.

Once Xu Ran’s figure had vanished, the Red Brocade Bird let out a sharp and excited cry, flapping its wings as it began to soar in circles in its living area for a long time.

Round and round it went.

It had never felt this excited even during mating season.

"What time is it now?"

In the meeting room of the Beast Master Association, a chief evaluator inquired casually.

"It’s ten o’clock in the morning," one evaluator answered promptly, then turned to another person in the room, "Old Zhou, isn’t it time to feed your Red Brocade Bird?"

"Correct," the evaluator known as "Old Zhou" nodded, "Its last meal was at seven in the morning. According to its usual habits, it should be hungry by now."@@novelbin@@

"Looks like the owner of Starfire Foster is about to face a new round of challenges," the questioning evaluator chuckled, "Old Zhou’s Red Brocade Bird is probably the pickiest eater of all our Pet Beasts, isn’t it?"

"Indeed, speaking of pickiness, that Red Brocade Bird is the worst," another evaluator agreed, then turned to Old Zhou, "You should ask Red Brocade Bird if it has been fed."

The other evaluators echoed the sentiment, their gazes turning toward Old Zhou.

If it hadn’t been fed and the Red Brocade Bird was left hungry, the foster experience would undoubtedly incur a penalty.

Even if it had been fed, failing to cater to the Red Brocade Bird’s taste would also result in a deduction of points.

Being in a no-win situation, they were quite keen to see how the owner of the foster shop would handle this dilemma.

"Just a moment, I’ll ask," Old Zhou nodded and swiftly connected with the Pet Beast through Contractual Sensing.

"Red Cloud, how are you feeling?"

"Lii~" (I’m great! Incredibly great! You have no idea!)

When Old Zhou sensed the unusually high excitement in the Red Brocade Bird’s thoughts, he frowned slightly.

"Have you eaten? How was the taste?"

"Lii~" (Just finished eating, it was so good it blew my mind!)

Old Zhou: "…"

Do birds use idioms like that?

He was about to ask more when the Red Brocade Bird sent an impatient thought.

"Lii~" (Busy flying in circles here, let’s chat later!)

After that, the Red Brocade Bird promptly severed the Contractual Sensing on its own.

In that instant, Old Zhou was utterly speechless.

Seeing Old Zhou fall silent with a shifting expression, the other evaluators felt as if cats were clawing at their hearts. One of the evaluators sitting next to him couldn’t help but pat his shoulder, "What’s the situation, Old Zhou? Was it fed?"

"Ah... it was fed," Old Zhou snapped back to reality, answering his colleague reflexively.

"Not bad, so it was actually fed. I thought the owner of the foster shop might forget."

"They’ve got a Pet Beast with which they can communicate freely, understanding Red Brocade Bird’s dietary habits shouldn’t be a problem."

"But with the Red Brocade Bird being so finicky, even if it was fed, I doubt the results were good," one of the evaluators remarked.

The evaluators spoke one after another until all their gazes converged on Old Zhou.

"How did the Red Brocade Bird feel after eating?"

"Well…" Old Zhou hesitated for a moment, then spoke somewhat uncertainly.

"Soul... soul-stirring?"

-----------------

The evaluators from the organizing body were dumbfounded, while on the other side at Starfire Foster, Xu Ran faced a new problem.

"You don’t want to eat?"

He looked at the Cloud Stepping Fox in front of him, frowning involuntarily.

This Cloud Stepping Fox was thinner than a typical Pet Beast’s build, it really should eat more to make up for it.

Yet, this Cloud Stepping Fox was refusing to cooperate.

"Ying~" (I’m too fat, I need to diet!)

The Cloud Stepping Fox spoke earnestly, looking very determined.

It wouldn’t touch the food at all!

Xu Ran fell silent for a moment and glanced at the Pleasure value income prompt.

When he first entered here, the Cloud Stepping Fox provided 5 points of Pleasure value at once, but now it had dropped to 3 points.
