Chapter 791 - 377 The Dying Tree, Rebirth Of Life

```

"Xi Lu~"

Accompanied by a prolonged neigh, Star’s rushing speed gradually slowed down, and eventually, its blurred silhouette became clear as its physique, shrouded in starlight, exuded a robust sense of power.

At this moment, it had reached the border between the 47th and 76th Beast Fields, an area composed of a forest of withered trees. Under the night sky, the bare branches resembled sinister, contorted claws, hiding pulsations that sent shivers down one’s spine.

Xu Ran glanced at the Withered Wood Forest close at hand and opened the map and information on the 76th Beast Field given to him by Qi Yuan. Before long, his voice slightly rose, "A Beast King lives here."

"Catch it and see if it knows about the whereabouts of the Demon Wood Semi-Saint."

As he spoke these words, Xu Ran couldn’t help but feel a bit sentimental.

Back when he was still in the 97th Beast Field, a Beast King was an unreachable existence for him. Just the approach of a single Beast King could bring a 3rd Level town to the brink of destruction.

But now, for him, the Beast King Level had become something he could manipulate at will.

Ziyun didn’t even bother to move; he waved a claw towards Cancan, who was itching to try, signaling that this minor character was enough for the third youngest to handle.

"Cha! (Watch me!)"

Cancan melded into the ground, disappearing swiftly. Shortly after, he returned easily, gripping a gigantic wolf covered in blood-red fur before Xu Ran.

The Gigantic Wolf Beast King, radiating an aura of Darkness, initially harbored a desire to resist, but upon seeing the Imperial Crowns of Ziyun and Star, it cowered like a trembling dog, lying obediently on the ground, daring not to move.

Xu Ran drew the Mozhui Blade and casually swiped it near the Gigantic Wolf Beast King’s body, leaving a deep gash tens of meters long on the ground. He then thrust the blade’s tip into the earth before the Beast King and squatted down, peering into its eyes.

"I’m going to ask you some questions. If you answer truthfully, I won’t harm you."

"Ask away. As long as I know, I’ll tell you everything," the Gigantic Wolf Beast King spoke, sensing an aura from this human even more terrifying than that of the Emperor Species, it dared not entertain any other thoughts and hurriedly pledged cooperation.

Seeing this, Xu Ran nodded in satisfaction.

"Have you been living in this Withered Wood Forest all this time?"

"Yes...yes," the Gigantic Wolf Beast King nodded fervently, "Recently, my lair has been deep within the Withered Wood Forest. Except for the occasional foray out every three to five days to hunt, I don’t leave."

"Then, in the past few days, have you seen any powerful creatures passing through here?" Xu Ran’s voice rose slightly. Read new chapters at empire

"Powerful creatures..." The Gigantic Wolf Beast King pondered hard but eventually shook its head, "The most powerful being that has passed by here lately is you."

"Hmm..." Xu Ran stroked his chin, his expression contemplative.

That made sense. If the Demon Wood Semi-Saint really passed through this place, it would have likely gone to great lengths to conceal its presence to avoid being detected.

With its means, the Gigantic Wolf Beast King wouldn’t have been able to sense anything.

Xu Ran decided to change his line of questioning.

"In that case, have you seen any plant-type Transcendent Beings or found anything related to trees during this time?"

"This..." The pupils of the Gigantic Wolf Beast King constricted, a flicker of hesitation and conflict passing through its eyes.

This did not escape Xu Ran’s notice.

His heart leapt with joy, and he immediately spoke in a stern voice, "Think carefully. If you conceal anything, you will undoubtedly die!"

"I..." The Gigantic Wolf Beast King hesitated for a moment, then said slowly, "If I tell you, will you truly not kill me?"

"You’re not in a position to negotiate terms."

"Alright then." With a sigh in its heart, the Gigantic Wolf Beast King spoke through gritted teeth, "Yesterday, as I roamed near the Withered Wood Forest, I stumbled upon a treasure that seemed to be shaped like a branch."

A branch?

Xu Ran felt a surge of excitement, "Show it to me quickly!"

"The branch is in my lair," the Gigantic Wolf Beast King shrank back slightly.

"Lead the way," Xu Ran demanded without hesitation.

With him and the five pets far surpassing the strength of the Gigantic Wolf Beast King and with intelligence pointing to no stronger presence nearby, he had no fear of deception.

"Follow me." Having revealed his stroke of luck, the Gigantic Wolf Beast King seemed to have resigned to its fate. Turning around, it led the way, with one man and five pets swiftly reaching the very heart of the Withered Wood Forest, its lair.

It was a massive hollowed tree with a pile of bones outside, belonging to humans as well as various Transcendent Beings.@@novelbin@@

This Gigantic Wolf, easily manipulated by Xu Ran and his five companions, had a fearsome reputation in the 76th Beast Field, and the Withered Wood Forest had become a forbidden zone.

The Gigantic Wolf Beast King emerged from its lair, soon carrying a branch about one meter in length in its mouth, placing it before Xu Ran. "This is what I found."

On the branch surged vibrant life, enveloped in a mysterious power that made it look extraordinary. The branch sported lines of cyan and gold light, now quite dim but still clear.

Seeing these patterns, Xu Ran knew his guess was correct.

This was indeed the branch left by the Demon Wood Semi-Saint.

Worry crept over him.

From the perspective of the Demon Wood Semi-Saint, it clearly wouldn’t want its whereabouts to be exposed, making it unlikely to have deliberately left behind this piece of its branch.

Most likely, it had been severely injured.

Plant-type Transcendent Beings had a lower sensitivity to their own bodies compared to typical Transcendent Beings. They wouldn’t feel pain from the loss of a branch or the fall of a leaf.
