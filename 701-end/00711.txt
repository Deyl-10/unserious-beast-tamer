Chapter 716 - 341: Kill The Exhibition In Advance!_3

At this time yesterday, they were all behaving so uncooperatively that they even stood at the entrance of the Foster Shop and refused to come in.

But today, their behavior had completely changed.

Every Pet Beast moved sluggishly, their faces overtaken by obvious reluctance.

After experiencing the meticulous care of the Starfire Foster Shop, they were no longer willing to leave.

Not surprised by this scene, the staff member sighed helplessly, then gently addressed the twenty Pet Beast judges, "Today we will visit the next Foster Shop, I believe they will also go all out to provide you with comfortable service."

"Now, it’s time for us to set off."

The twenty Pet Beast judges followed the employee, looking back three times with every step they took as they left the Starfire Foster Shop.

Watching their retreating figures disappear from view, Xu Ran casually closed the door of the Starfire Foster Shop and then hung a "Closed for Business" sign on it.

He had already agreed with the five little ones that once the Pet Beast exhibition ended, he would take them to Xieyun City to enter both Poison Flame Valley and Silent Abyss.

The former was the evolution ground for Firefly.

The latter might contain clues about the last piece of evolutionary material needed for star evolution, the Town Star Stone.

"Are you all ready?" Xu Ran turned and looked behind him.

The five little ones had long been ready to go, anticipation written all over their faces.

"Lu Hou!" (Ready!)

Firefly swung its bear paw emphatically, its crimson eyes filled with burning battle spirit.

At this moment, it was noticeably leaner compared to when it had first bonded with him.

This leanness was not the emaciation of illness but a robustness filled with the sense of power.

All of this stemmed from its incredibly diligent training efforts.

Perhaps because of its origins and experiences in its youth, Firefly was the only one among the five whose training effort could rival that of Star’s.

Apart from the six hours in the Training Area, Firefly also tried its best to train in the Foster Area.

It was well aware of its extraordinary nature.

Being of a mutant breed, its path to advancement had been utterly blocked, but now with Xu Ran’s help, it finally saw a sliver of opportunity.

It was determined to seize this opportunity, regardless of the effort required.

Such arduous effort had also paid off handsomely.

Firefly’s Talent Skills had already been upgraded to Full Moon Level for three of them, meeting the small goal it had set for itself. Find your adventure at empire

To possess three Full Moon Level skills before evolution!

"Xi Lu~" (I hope we can successfully find the Town Star Stone this time.)

Star raised a hoof and gently touched the Dawn Star Radiance hanging around its neck, softly neighing.

The other three were also brimming with enthusiasm.

Although this mission wasn’t directly related to each of them, as companions who lived together day and night, they had already formed a good tradition of mutual support through the countless times they had shared resources.

The affairs of Firefly and Star were their affairs too.

"We’re setting off!"

Xu Ran smiled faintly, his figure disappearing inside the Starfire Foster Shop in Xuanxing City.

Moments later, a sudden Hexagram Star Array appeared within the shop and transmitted the five little ones away.

As one man and five beasts headed for Xieyun City, in another part of Xuanxing City, a Foster Shop named Mad Wolf Foster Shop opened its doors early, its decorations bright and festive.

The owner of the Mad Wolf Foster Shop wore joyous attire, standing outside the door like a doorman, quietly waiting.@@novelbin@@

Behind him, the employees of the Foster Shop stood neatly in two rows, uniforms matching.

Their preparation seemed thorough.
