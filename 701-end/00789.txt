Chapter 793 - 378: Broken Realm Core!

Earth attribute Power…

Xu Ran’s eyes widened abruptly as he belatedly realized the problem.

The Demon Wood Semi-Saint’s attribute had already changed from the original Earth attribute to the Order Attribute after evolving into the Holy Spirit Race. Saints, while possessing the Leap Attribute, were supposed to completely abandon their original attributes.

So, it shouldn’t have absorbed the Earth attribute Power so easily.

"Senior… you…" Xu Ran suddenly found his voice strained, "are you no longer part of the Holy Spirit Race?"

"You could say that." The Demon Wood Semi-Saint spoke softly, looking at the young man before it, "You’ve seen what just happened."

"My injuries are severe, my lifeforce flickering like a candle in the wind, at risk of being extinguished at any moment."

"The Power of Order is strong, but it is not omnipotent."

"At least, it is far inferior to the Earth attribute in this respect."

"The Earth attribute is the ground, the origin of life."

"It harbors an inexhaustible, majestic lifeforce, and only it can help me break the current deadlock and rally once more."

"The sliver of Power you brought me has awakened my dormant consciousness, and with it, I have successfully completed another transformation of my attribute," the Demon Wood Semi-Saint explained as it continued to grow taller. Its aura was gradually becoming stronger, recovering to the level of a Beast Emperor.

"Then…Senior, do you still have a chance to return to your original strength?" Xu Ran couldn’t help but ask, "Is there a chance for you to change back to the Leap Attribute and then evolve back?"

"Yes." The Demon Wood Semi-Saint spoke quietly, "But it won’t be the Order Attribute again."

"Each Leap Attribute is unique, and even among the same race in evolution, there is a unique understanding of the Leap Attribute."

"To revert to the original attribute is to seal off one’s past path." The voice of the Demon Wood Semi-Saint was solemn, "To evolve back into the Holy Spirit Race, I need to find another way."

Seeing the worried expression on Xu Ran’s face, the Demon Wood Semi-Saint suddenly smiled, "But don’t worry, even if I fall back to the Emperor Stage, I will not be comparable to an ordinary Beast Emperor."

Your next chapter is on empire

"After all, I once stepped into the domain of the Saints," the Demon Wood Semi-Saint said confidently, "I will personally annihilate the Beast Emperors that threaten us from Beast Field number 47."

"Senior, I’m not worried about that," Xu Ran said, shaking his head helplessly.

Hearing this, the Demon Wood Semi-Saint stared steadily at Xu Ran and then chuckled lightly, extending a branch to gently touch Xu Ran’s forehead, "You’re a good kid."

As it reverted to its original attribute, new green leaves hung from its branches, and upon touching Xu Ran, a rich and majestic lifeforce unfurled, revitalizing the weary Xu Ran in an instant.@@novelbin@@

"The gift I once gave you has now been returned in full, and it has once again helped me greatly," the Demon Wood Semi-Saint said softly, "I don’t know how to thank you properly."

"If you can drive back the invading Beast Emperors from Beast Field number 8, that will be enough for me," Xu Ran replied, shaking his head slightly to indicate he required no thanks.

He hadn’t come here for that.

"Having said that, I’d feel troubled if I didn’t show some gratitude," the Demon Wood Semi-Saint pondered for a moment, then extended a branch on which hung a colorful, shattered glaze.

"Fighting three-on-one was far beyond my own abilities."

"So even though I won that battle, I also lost."

"I used up all of the resources I had once obtained, but they were not enough to save myself."

"Only this item, which I could not recognize, remained untouched."

"Now that I no longer have a use for it, I shall gift it to you," said the Demon Wood Semi-Saint with a hint of expectation, "I think, in your hands, it will truly serve its purpose."

"Hmm?" Xu Ran stared at the strange yet somewhat familiar resource, his eyes widening in surprise.

Could this be… the Broken Realm Core?!

His expression became complicated in an instant, and he couldn’t help but turn to look at Twelve, whose face was filled with excitement.

The Broken Realm Core was the last Evolution Material needed for Twelve’s evolution.

This material was very mysterious; in Beast Field number 47, Xu Ran had been unable to find much information about it.

It was only when he had recently entered Broken Abyss City and attempted to exchange Evolution Resources for his Pet Beast that he first received information and images of the Broken Realm Core.

The last time the Broken Realm Core had appeared in Broken Abyss City was over a hundred years ago.

In a sense, it was even rarer and more elusive than the Town Star Stone.

It was the core left behind by a naturally shattered mini-space, lingering at the edges of the world, and only the Holy Spirit Race, with their Leap Attribute and its relevance to space, had a slight chance of capturing it.

Xu Ran had been prepared to search for it with even greater effort once affairs here were settled, perhaps even with the help of Broken Abyss City’s resources to a certain extent.

Who would have thought that the Broken Realm Core would appear in front of him so dramatically?

"It seems you recognize it," the Demon Wood Semi-Saint nudged the Broken Realm Core closer, "Since that’s the case, take it."

"Thank you, Senior," Xu Ran took the Broken Realm Core.

If it were any other resource, he might not have accepted it.

But this resource was too important for Twelve; he had to take it.

"What’s the situation in Beast Field number 47 now?" the Demon Wood Semi-Saint continued its recovery while slowly speaking, "Tell me about it."

"Alright." Xu Ran tucked the Broken Realm Core away and then recounted what had transpired after the Demon Wood Semi-Saint’s disappearance.
