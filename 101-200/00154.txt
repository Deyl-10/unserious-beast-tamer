[Additional 4/10 chapters for the Silver Alliance Warm Sun 1314]

Watching the man and his dog walk away, Xu Ran gradually lowered his hand that had been hanging in the air. The smile on his face grew even more intense. Lucky Liu, truly deserving of his name!

He finally found a clue to the Heart of the Thunder Stone that had troubled him for many days in Lucky Liu’s casual words!

Although Liu Gu always believed that the power of a strong thunder-attributed Transcendent Being who had fallen was what covered that area with thunderclouds all year round, after hearing Liu Gu mention that the thunderclouds suddenly faded, Xu Ran was almost certain that it was related to the Heart of the Thunder Stone!

The last piece of the puzzle for evolution has been found!

Besides that, he drew a purple again from the ten consecutive lottery drawing.

Although it wasn’t the anticipated King Species evolutionary route, it was a familiar face nonetheless.

[Meditation Acceleration Card]

Counting the time, two to three weeks had passed since the end of the competition.

The last Meditation Acceleration Card he drew was going to expire in two to three days.

Getting a new Meditation Acceleration Card at this time would directly extend the subscription for another month!

Given Xu Ran’s calculations of the progress of the meditation, the second Meditation Acceleration Card was enough for him to break through the third stage of contract power!

Thinking of his strength swiftly skyrocketing like a rocket in a short period of time, Xu Ran couldn’t help but reveal a look of joy on his face.

Besides the Meditation Acceleration Card, he gained seven Skill Fusion Stones and two Energy Abundant Potions from this lottery drawing, identical to the last ten consecutive draw.

So…

It’s time for the settlement now!

“Stop training and come up!”

The Contractual Sensing immediately transmitted Xu Ran’s voice into the training areas of the Thunder and Dark attributes, causing the two Pet Beast who were training hard to stop their movements.

Usually, Xu Ran would not interrupt their training.

And once interrupted, it meant…

Something big is happening!

A few minutes later, both Pet Beasts appeared before Xu Ran, looking at him expectantly.

And Xu Ran’s first sentence made Ziyun and the Star know that everything was as they had conjectured!

“The location of the Heart of the Thunder Stone has been found!”

“Meow?!” (Really?!)

Ziyun’s eyes widened dramatically.

It had waited for a week, and finally there was news!

“Of course it’s true, we’re closing the store early this afternoon and following Uncle Liu and the Tiger Hunting Squad out of the city.” Xu Ran smiled, “If this trip goes well, the evolution resources should be gathered.”

“Besides, the elite level Pet Beasts already have considerable strength, this is also an opportunity to test your training achievements during this period.” The two Pet Beasts nodded their heads in unison, their eyes bursting with fighting spirit.

During this week, they absolutely didn’t slack off at all!

This can be observed from their status data!

Race name: Electric Chasing Cat

[★Self-healing Power (Starlight Level)] (264/500) [+]

[★Blood fury (Starlight Level)] (217/500) [+] ] @@novelbin@@

During these seven days of training, Ziyun did not use any skill points at all, but the Thunder Shake Heavenly Sound, which was previously leveled up, took the lead and became the first to break through to the Waning Moon Level!

During this period, Ziyun had to allocate one hour every day from its precious six hours of training time to go to its most hated Earth attribute training area.

There, relying on its physical strength, it climbed a cliff as tall as three hundred meters.

In order to evolve, the traditionally somewhat lazy Ziyun was going all out.

[Contract Pet Beast: Star

Race name: Night Colt

Attribute: Dark

Growth Level: Elite Stage (6521/20000) [+]

Race Level: Leader Species

Skills:

[★★Twilight Watch (Starlight Level)] (142/500) [+]

[★★Night Eyes (Starlight Level)] (109/500) [+]

[★★Night Song (Starlight Level)] (137/500) [+]

[★Tenacity (Starlight Level)] (165/500) [+]

[★Self-healing Power (Stardust Level)] (74/100) [+] ]

As there were no Energy Abundant Potions, Star’s skill proficiency increased relatively slower. But it strictly executed Xu Ran’s training plan, focusing more on Twilight Watch and Star Chain training, and then on other skills.

A week ago, all of its two-star skills were just at the beginning of the Starlight

Level. Now, the increase in proficiency is visible to the naked eye.

“You have both made great progress.” After reviewing the detailed situations of both Pet Beasts, Xu Ran shut down the panel and dragged out a small blackboard from a corner of the shop, “So, it’s time to allocate new resources.”

“Meow!” (Here it comes!)

Ziyun’s eyes suddenly become sharp.

This time, it won’t be in debt!

“Xi Lu Lu!” (I’m ready!)

Star raised a front hoof, tracing irregularly in the air, as if it’s reviewing how to write.

Under the expectant looks of the two Pet Beasts, Xu Ran quickly wrote:

“Physical Points: 2484 points (unsettled)”

Skill Points: 210 points (Ziyun) + 620 points (unsettled)”

“Teachable skills: ★★ Insightful Eye (Star)”
