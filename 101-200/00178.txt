Chapter 178: Chapter 123: B Level Drug Application! 2

Translator: 549690339 |???? —

The Boss Cat stared at his own reflection in the mirror for a good while, his face finally revealing an apparent expression of surprise and joy.

There was no pet beast who didn’t like looking more attractive. The new fierce and powerful appearance hit right at its heart in just an instant.

“It seems to like it,” Xu Ran laughed lightly, leading it out of the grooming room.

“Bring the stray pet beasts that need grooming every afternoon from now on.”

“Over the course of five days, Starfire Foster Care Shop has displayed an immense sense of social responsibility. Using half its daily business hours, it provided free grooming for stray pet beasts in need, contributing their own power to the improvement of the city’s appearance.”

According to incomplete statistics, Starfire Foster Care Shop lost more than 400,000 yuan in total in this free grooming event for stray pet beasts. But Mr. Xu Ran, the boss of Starfire Foster Care Shop, stated that he will continue to run such activities.”

“In the future, stray pet beasts that need grooming can come directly to avail of the free grooming service.”

“In the past five days, due to their improved appearances after grooming, a total of seventeen stray pet beasts found matching Beast Masters. We have every reason to believe that this number will continue to increase.”

“After launching a new training service, Starfire Foster Care Shop once again launched a public welfare activity, contributing to the prosperity of Qingzhou City, demonstrating the sense of mission of a businessman.”

We hope that more businessmen will come forward to contribute their own strength to the prosperity of the city.”

“Our station reporter will continue to report for you.”

Awesome!!!” Xu Ran applauded and smiled contentedly, “What profoundly clever product placement! I refuse to believe there is anyone who still doesn’t know we offer training services.”

The Beast Master Association really went all out this time. I initially planned on just running a small ad in the newspaper, but they arranged for a news broadcast.” Xu Ran grinned, “I suppose it’s because the grooming results were more impressive than even they had anticipated.”

Even Xu Ran himself hadn’t expected the five days of grooming to produce such interesting results.

Because of the excellent grooming outcomes, numerous Beast Masters seeking contract pet beasts came to them, crowding the shop front every afternoon.

The stray pet beasts, once neglected and unwanted, had now unexpectedly become in high demand.

“Such a superficial world,”

Xu Ran sighed, stretched lazily and glanced at Ziyun and Star on the side.

Who isn’t superficial?

“Business is closed for the day, let’s go feed the boarders together, and prepare our own dinner while we’re at it.”

“Meow-”

Ziyun elegantly licked its paw, standing up from the counter. Its fluffy tail rose high, a Combatforce Strong Ring strapped to each limb, yet its stride appeared quite at ease.

Suspended around its neck was a necklace with a pendant resembling a blue and purple crystal. Under the lights, it shimmered with brilliant colours. It was the Blue Electric Liuli, which had been worn for five days.

Suppertime!

Alighting gracefully from the counter, the thought of indulging in the day’s meals put a spring in Ziyun’s steps.

Mealtime was the most rewarding moment after a hard day’s training.

Over the last five days, Ziyun maintained an unwavering six-hour high-intensity training regimen, substituting energy blocks to supplement its energy in the absence of the Energy Abundant Potion.

An energy block could sustain approximately one hour of training, and Ziyun needed to consume three general attribute and three dual attribute energy blocks every day, which was quite a headache for the impoverished creature.

After using and comparing, the dual attribute energy blocks, although expensive, proved justifiably superior to the general attribute blocks.

So, despite further burdening its already strained finances, Ziyun decided to exchange all its future points for dual attribute energy blocks.

The usage of over half the energy blocks and the influx of two items of training resources over five days also notably enhanced Ziyun’s strength.

When it had just evolved, Ziyun’s growth stage progression was (21376/30000) Now, after merely five days, it had already reached (26435/3OOOO), increasing by over 5000, or by about 1000 points a day on average. @@novelbin@@

At this rate, it would achieve the satisfactory standard of the elite stage before the exhaustion of all resources.

“Xii Luu Lulu-” (Let’s go now!)

Star neighed, closely following Ziyun, equally eager for mealtime.

Around its sturdy neck was a deep, dark pearl necklace, shimmering mysteriously in the light, and clinking melodiously from its hooves were horseshoes made from crystal material.

Although weaker than Ziyun at the moment, Star matched Ziyun’s consumption of energy blocks over the last five days. It also had two resource items and an even more precious resource in the underground foster zone.

Under such an abundance of resources, Star’s progress had even surpassed Ziyun’s.

Its original growth progress (7763/20000) had, in such a short time, soared to (14025/20000), increasing by more than six thousand points.

Considering that the effect of Dark Horseshoes is more reflected in Star’s speed than its power, Star’s actual enhancement would be more significant than it appears.

Xu Ran’s earlier plan was accurate; while adding points is powerful, it barely keeps up with the speed at which the two pet beasts are improving. For the time being, other enhancement methods are needed. The Beast Master points in exchange for resources are the best supplementary method.

“You two wait for me!” Seeing the rushed Ziyun and Star, Xu Ran followed them with a quick smile. The three of them quickly arrived at the foster area on the underground floor.

So much time had passed since the start of the foster care services, and Xu Ran had established a regular feeding schedule.

Before opening the shop every day, at midday and after the business closes in the afternoon, he feeds the lodgers at these three time slots.

Taking into account the different habits of various pet beasts, he prepares their corresponding meals in advance or takes other measures to ensure that every pet beast feels at home.

Because of this, the pet beasts in the shop are already familiar with Xu Ran’s feeding routine.

When they had descended the staircase, the pet beast lodgers in the foster shop were already sitting in a row, waiting quietly.

To avoid being the last one fed by Xu Ran, even the most mischievous and warlike beast is behaving rather well at the moment.

Soon, Xu Ran walked out of the configuration room with big and small food bowls in his hands.

“Dinner time!”

“Arrwooo-”

The Frost Dust Wolf howled excitedly, rushed forward to sniff its bowl, and found its dinner in no time.

Afterward, the other pet beasts successively grabbed their food bowls, found a spot they liked, and started eating.

“■■■Twenty-nine, thirty.” Xu Ran distributed the food while counting the number of pet beasts, then nodded to demonstrate his satisfaction.

Everyone is here.

The Stone Armored Dragon was taken away by Zhang Yun, who came back from work two days ago. After a day of not having enough lodgers, a new lodger moved in early in the morning, making the amount of fostered pet beasts in the shop reach its limit again.

Xu Ran opened his personal panel and took a look.

[Drug Application (C Level)] (470/500)

Right after midnight today, the 30 experience points that will be credited will allow the Drug Application skill to be upgraded to B Level, another piece of good news.

“Let’s eat too.”

Seeing the hopeful gazes from Ziyun and Star, Xu Ran smiled, turned around and went back into the configuration room, carrying out the loving dinner he had prepared just for the two pet beasts.

Both pet beasts had trained so hard, they naturally deserved to be given proper nutrition.

As for himself, he picked up a bowl of dumplings, squatted on the ground, and started eating hastily.

When everyone had finished eating, Xu Ran collected the bowls, said goodbye to Star, and went straight to the living area on the second floor with Ziyun.

During this period, he had not stopped meditating.

The first Meditation Acceleration Card had already expired, and now the second one had started working, continuing to accelerate his contract power improvement at a hundred times the speed.

According to his estimation, his contract power could successfully break through to the third stage in about half a month.

That night, the alarm clock he had set to go off at midnight rang.

Xu Ran opened his eyes in the middle of his meditation and read the text before them.
