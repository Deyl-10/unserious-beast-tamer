Chapter 182: Chapter 125 The First Three Stars of Star!_2

“This drop of blood essence comes from the Night Demon Dragon.

“Xi Lu?” (What do you mean?)

Star Prime blinked, a little confused.

Night Demon Dragon. This seems to be related to its first primary resource, right?

The blood essence also comes from the Night Demon Dragon. That sounds like

a good thing, doesn’t it?

“This means that the Night Demon Dragon can reach the King Stage.” Seeing that Star Prime still hadn’t sensed the problem, Xu Ran sighed and lightly tapped its head.

“Xi Lull!”

Star Prime’s eyes widened suddenly.

Now it understood.

The Night Demon Dragon could advance to the King Stage, signifying it belonged to the King Species.

Then, the single horn of a mature Night Demon Dragon…

“Things are not so bad.” Xu Ran gently consoled the worried Star Prime, “The

Night Demon Dragon is indeed a King Species, but it doesn’t mean that it only matures upon reaching the King Stage.”

“Normally, a Night Demon Dragon at the General stage is already considered

mature.”

“So, the single horn of the General stage…” Xu Ran paused mid-sentence, falling to silence.

The single horn of a General Stage Night Demon Dragon, even though it ranked lower than the King Stage one.

Still, it didn’t sound cheap…

Xu Ran gnashed his teeth in vexation.

Originally, he thought the Night Demon Dragon was a Leader Species. So, if traces of them were found outside the city, after Ziyun broke through to the Leader Stage, she probably could kill one by herself and get its horn.

Now, it looks like this plan is a no-go.

By the time Ziyun breaks through to the General Stage, it will be too late. Resources from Transcendent Beings, unlike the naturally occurring Heart of the Thunder Stone, are near impossible to acquire on your own without sufficient power.

We can only hope that there are people willing to part with them, perhaps exchange at the Beast Master Association.

The first option is unlikely, after all, in the entire Qingzhou City, apart from Senior Gu, there wouldn’t be others who possessed the strength to kill a creature of the General Stage.

As for the later…

The Beast Master Association in Qingzhou City might not have such items for exchange, we would have to go to other cities.

A thought flashed through Xu Ran’s mind, reminding him of Senior Gu’s previous invitation.

If Senior Gu were to escort him the entire way, ensuring safety, he could go to

Xieyun City and exchange for the matured Night Demon Dragon’s horn. That seemed like a pretty good plan.

Initially, Xu Ran had no need to go to Xieyun City, but now that he had obtained the evolutionary path, he had a new requirement.

So that’s the plan for now. When Senior Gu returns next time, let him know!

As for the last main evolutionary resource, Star Dust, Xu Ran had not found it

yet.

But based on Ziyun’s previous evolution, the arrangement of the three main materials is ordered according to their value. The value of Star Dust should be lower than the Dark Attribute King Stage Blood Essence, which is relatively rare.

Firstly, see if he could exchange it in Qingzhou City. If not, he could just exchange it when he gets to Xieyun City!

With a plan in mind, Xu Ran let out a sigh of relief.

Upon comparison, it seemed that gathering the evolution materials for Star

Prime is going to be a bit easier than Ziyun.

For what he currently could not exchange, he could always go to Xieyun City

for it.

“Next, it’s skill fusion.” Xu Ran took a deep breath, “I just hope you have better luck in fusing skills next time. Otherwise, five three-star skills will require too many skill fusion stones.”

“Meow-”

Ziyun nodded in agreement.

Before Star Prime had even signed a contract, it had already used quite a bit of skill fusion stones. It barely managed to meet the Waning Moon Level evolution conditions with four three-star skills before evolving. The evolution conditions for Star Prime now are even more difficult, it’s going to be a tough journey.

“Xi Lu!” (Let’s first fuse Night Hunting Pupil into a three-star skill!)

Star Prime took a deep breath, tightly shut its eyes, and a look of nervousness appeared on its face.

This was currently its only fused skill. Instead of fusing with other skills first,

it was better to step up this skill to three stars first.

“Alright.” Xu Ran nodded slightly, opened the dark attribute skills and general skills, and started to find the two-star skill with the highest fusion success rate with Night Hunting Pupil.

At the moment, Star Prime had reached 60 skill fragments. Exchanging for a two-star skill was not a problem.

Soon, Xu Ran locked onto a two-star skill named Night Hunt in the Dark attribute skills exchange list.

To his surprise, this skill was not one that increased visual acuity.

Its effect was to lock onto an opponent and temporarily gain their line of sight.

Tracking, huh…

If it weren’t for the visible fusion probability, Xu Ran would never have thought that such a skill could be fused with Night Hunting Pupil. @@novelbin@@

But upon closer thought, it was quite promising.

“Two-star Night Hunt” + “Two-star Night Hunting Pupil”

“Fusion success rate: 6.1%”

“Proceed to fusion?”

“Yes” “No”

Fuse!

Under the tense atmosphere of one man and two beasts, four stones went

down…

“Fusion Success”

-Two-star Night Hunting Pupil (Starlight Level)” (214/500)”+”

Hl

[**★ Night Inspection (Starlight Level)] (214/5OO)[+]

“Success!” A satisfied smile emerged on Xu Ran’s face.

Four out of nine were successful, it was rather good luck.

On the other side, Star had a slightly stunned expression.

While a large amount of information emerged in his mind, he also felt an uncontrollable joy from within his body, as if a shackle was broken, and his life level was elevated.

Ziyun had experienced this feeling several times, but for Star, it was the first.

Finally, he had his first three-star skill!

Gradually coming back to his senses, Star couldn’t hold back from lifting his front hoofs, letting out an excited neigh.

“Xi Lu!” (Great!)

“There are still four skill fusion stones left, and they still have 20 skill fragments.” Xu Ran’s voice paused for a moment, “Should I also take the opportunity to advance Tenacity to two stars?”

As he spoke, he casually opened Star’s panel.

[Contract Pet Beast: Star]

Race name: Night Colt

Attribute: Darkness

Growth Stage: Elite Stage (14625/20000)!+]

Race Stage: Leader Stage

Skills:

[★★★ Night Inspection (Starlight Level)](214/5OO)[+]

[★★ Twilight Watch (Starlight Level)](253/5oo)[+l

Star Chain (Starlight Level)](264/5oo)[+]

[★★ Night Song (Starlight Level)](238/5OO)[+]

[★★ Nightfall (Starlight Level)](202/500)[+]

[★ Tenacity (Starlight Level)](3Ol/5OO)[+]

[★ Self-healing Power (Starlight Level)](81/5OO)[+]

The Tenacity skill, due to the recent lack of Energy Abundant Potions, has improved at a faster speed and is now the fastest training skill of Star.

Upgrading it to two stars would also help Star’s subsequent training.

“Xi Lu!” (Splendid!)

Star had no objections to Xu Ran’s arrangement.

The skill fusion was fortunate today, so they had to seize the opportunity!

Xu Ran nodded slightly, then opened the one-star Skills from the dark and common skills, and began to select one.

After a moment, his eyes settled on a one-star skill named Night Capture. “This skill… is quite interesting, huh?” Looking at the series introduction of this one-star skill, Xu Ran’s eyes gradually brightened.

Although one-star skills are a bit out of sight for Ziyun and Star, there are some interesting skills hidden among them.

Like the one in front of him.

Night Capture: Speeds up the absorption of darkness power to recover itself in a nocturnal environment.

This skill combined with Tenacity should result in a fun effect.

[★ Night Capture]+[* Tenacity]

[Fusion Success Rate: 15.2%]

[Proceed with Fusion?]

[Yes][No]

The fusion was successfully completed with the use of two fusion stones.

[* Tenacity (Starlight Level)](3Ol/5OO)[+]

Hl

[★★ Long Night (Starlight Level)](3Ol/5OO)[+]

“That’s it for today.” Xu Ran grinned.

Although there are still two skill fusion stones left, and there is hope to promote self-healing power to two stars, prioritizing the promotion of other skills to three stars is higher.

And two fusion stones are not enough for those skill fusions.

As for the skill points, like Ziyun, it’s a bit of a loss to allocate them right now. They should be kept until the evolution is nearly complete, and then allocate to where it is needed.

In the end, Xu Ran modified the blackboard after distribution.

“Skill Points: 540 points (Star)”

“Skill Fragments: 10 pieces (Star)”

“Energy Abundant Potion: 1 bottle (Star)”

“Skill Fusion Stone: 2 pieces (Star)”

“Beast Master Points: 2 points (Ziyun) + 4433 points (Star)”

It was another day where only Ziyun was poor in the whole world.
