Chapter 200: Chapter 134: Full Moon Level Proficiency!

Change of Situation! _2

Translator: 549690339

As for Xu Ran himself, after gripping his fists, he also felt his strength become increasingly powerful after the improvement.

Now, he wondered if he might have a chance of contending with weaker elite level pet beasts?

Surely, the boosting effect of the new skills was even better than that of Twilight Watch!

“What other effects does it have?” Xu Ran looked at Star expectantly with eager eyes.

The two skills fused with Twilight Watch weren’t simple ones.

These two weren’t Darkness Attribute skills, but they were among the rarer auxiliary ones in Common skills.

Guardian, could apply a shield on the chosen target, protecting it from attacks. Shared Destiny, like Star Chain, could link both parties. However, unlike Star

Chain, the linked parties could transfer and restore power to each other, rather than merging their power and sharing their abilities.

Based on Xu Ran’s estimate, the three-star skill obtained from fusing these two skills with Twilight Watch would have not only the initial boosting effect but likely also possess other new effects.

“Xi Lu…” (The rune has a protective effect…)

Star lifted a forehoof, indicating the black rune circling around Xu Ran, then began to whinny and explain.

After Star’s explanation, a joyful expression appeared on Xu Ran’s face.

There really were new effects!

The Guardian’s protective effect was perfectly integrated into the Night Rune and had been enhanced!

He was just now noticing that the rune on him was the same as what was on Ziyun.

This rune was woven from seven strands; according to Star’s introduction, each strand could block an attack with the same strength as Star.

As the skill’s proficiency continued to improve, the number of strands on the rune would increase, making the rune more complex.

Yet, it wasn’t only the Guardian skill that was perfectly merged!

The other skill, Shared Destiny’s effect, too, was there and had been intensified!

Shared Destiny linked both parties so that when one party was drained and not at its full strength, it could receive the same amount of power from the other party, thus helping the teammate recover to its full strength.

Essentially, it was a form of compensation for power consumption. The party who transferred the energy to help its teammate recover would also be quickly exhausted unless it was much stronger than its teammate.

In the Night Rune, the power transfer effect was inherited, and the linked object had been changed from two parties to multiple parties.

All the teammates marked with the rune could transfer their powers amongst themselves!

This meant that multiple teammates could support one teammate simultaneously, making the distribution of power consumption much more efficient!

“That will be it for skill fusion.” Xu Ran took a deep breath, “Next, it’s time to allocate skill points!”

“Xi Lu!” (I’m ready!)

Under Xu Ran’s rapid allocation of skill points, all of Star’s skills reached Waning Moon Level.

Star neighed, with an extremely excited look in its eyes.

Efforts pay off!

I will prove it with skill points allocation!

“Where to allocate the remaining 2000 skill points?”

Looking at Star’s (0/2000) skill proficiency progress bars, a look of expectancy appeared on Xu Ran’s face.

Full Moon Level skills, huh!

Was it finally going to be in his hands?

“Xi Lu Lu!” (Night Rune!)

Without any hesitation, Star chose the new three-star skill that had just been upgraded.

“Okay.” Xu Ran nodded, and immediately allocated the 2000 skill points.

**★ Night Rune (Waning Moon Level)](o/2000)[+]

HI

★★★ Night Rune (Full Moon Level)](0/10000)

It apparently takes ten thousand points to upgrade a skill from Full Moon Level to the next level…

Looking at the brand new progress bar, Xu Ran couldn’t help but sigh.

But when he saw what was behind the progress bar, his expression faltered a bit.

It seemed like something was missing.

Where was the plus sign for adding points?

Xu Ran wasn’t the first time seeing the plus sign for adding points disappear. When Ziyun and Star previously reached the Transcendent Stage and Leadership Stage respectively, the plus sign behind the growth stage progression bar would disappear, indicating a temporary halt in adding points. Now the sudden disappearance of the plus sign for skill point allocation obviously meant the same thing.

So… you can’t continue to add points to Full Moon Level skills at the Elite Stage?

Can a pet beast continue to improve its Full Moon Level skill proficiency levels through its own training?

Xu Ran scratched his chin thoughtfully.

This would only be clear after more of Star’s subsequent training.

It seems that in this world, it’s indeed rare for pet beasts to possess Full Moon

Level skills at the Elite Stage. Not that it’s completely unheard of, but it’s definitely considered exceptional.

“Star, how do you feel?” Xu Ran asked with a smile.

“Xi Lu!” (The Full Moon Level Night Rune is too powerful!)

As Star sensed the qualitatively transformed Night Rune inside of itself, excitement filled its purple eyes.

Through its description, Xu Ran also learned about the current state of the Night Rune.

The number of people that could simultaneously benefit from the Night Rune had increased to 20. Previously, this number was only eight, and it did not increase with each star added to the Twilight Watch.

Similarly, the number of lines in the Night Rune had jumped from seven to sixteen.

This meant that a single rune could withstand attacks equivalent to Star’s power sixteen times over.

And the rune could be applied again once depleted!

Furthermore, the most fundamental effect of the Night Rune—amplification- had also seen a significant improvement.

After Star applied it again to Ziyun, Xu Ran roughly estimated its effects. Previously, when Ziyun’s power reached thirty thousand, the Night Rune increased it almost to sixty thousand.

This amplification was truly terrifying.

Of course, there was a downside.

This skill already consumed a lot of energy and as its proficiency level increased, the energy consumed became even more frightening.

Forget about amplifying twenty targets at once, even when amplifying only two targets, Ziyun and Xu Ran, Star could barely hold on for about ten minutes. Full Moon Level proficiency wasn’t really meant for the Elite Stage.

“Great!” Xu Ran nodded approvingly. However, he immediately changed his tone, “But there’s some bad news. You can’t add skill points to a Full Moon Level skill for now.”

“If I’m not wrong, you can continue adding points only after you’ve broken through to the Leadership Stage.”

“Xi Lu” (Is that so…)

A bit disappointed, Star had hoped to experience the higher proficiency levels after feeling the power of the Full Moon Level.

However, considering that it had just reached Waning Moon Level with six other skills, Star didn’t find this too hard to accept.

By the time all its skills reached Full Moon Level, it’s cultivation would have probably crossed the Leadership Stage, right?

“Meow-” (It’s my turn! It’s my turn!)

Ziyun, who was at the side, couldn’t help but urge Xu Ran when she saw Star had managed to reach such a high proficiency level so quickly.

She wanted to level up, too! She wanted to reach Full Moon Level as well! “Alright, alright.” Xu Ran smiled wryly and opened Ziyun’s panel. [★★★Thunder Shake Heavenly Sound (Waning Moon Level)](3o8/2ooo)[+] [★★★Step on Electric Traces (Waning Moon Level)](278/2ooo)[+] [★★★Destruction Thunder Claw (Waning Moon Level)](283/2ooo)[+] [★★★Fighting Body (Waning Moon Level)](286/2000)[+] [★★★King’s Power (Starlight Level)](i78/5OO)[+] [★★Superfast Self-healing (Waning Moon Level)](35/2OOO)[+] [★★Heartfelt Strike (Starlight Level)](206/500)[+] [★★Falling Thunder (Starlight Level)](229/500)[+] [★Blood Fury (Waning Moon Level)](3/2ooo)[+]

It has been half a month since Ziyun evolved.

In this half month, stimulated by the sight of the giant beast’s corpse, Ziyun didn’t sit back satisfied with her strong power. Instead, she cherished every moment of the daily six-hour training time like Star and endeavored to improve herself. @@novelbin@@

The previously unachieved Waning Moon Level Superfast Self-healing and Blood Fury had both been achieved through Ziyun’s continuous efforts. With the evolution awakening of three skills – King’s Power, Heartfelt Strike, and Falling Thunder, they all had now reached Starlight Level.

“Which skill do you want to upgrade to Full Moon Level?” Xu Ran asked Ziyun. “Meow!” (Thunder Shake Heavenly Sound! Invest all the extra skill points in Fighting Body!)

Ziyun replied without hesitation.

Perhaps because she had a Fighting Attribute, after her Battle Instinct skill evolved into Fighting Body, Ziyun liked it even more than Step on Electric Traces, which she had previously ignored.

Xu Ran nodded slightly and quickly poured the points into the skills. [★★★Thunder Shake Heavenly Sound (Full Moon Level)](o/ioooo) [★★★Fighting Body (Waning Moon Level)](353/2OOO)[+] [★★★King’s Power (Waning Moon Level)](o/20oo)[+] [★★Heartfelt Strike (Waning Moon Level)](0/2000)[+] [★★Falling Thunder (Waning Moon Level)](o/2ooo)[+] All done, time to call it a day!
