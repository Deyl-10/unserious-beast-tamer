As for the skill fusion stones…

A rare hint of hesitation crossed his face.

The number of stones needed to succeed in fusion was uncertain.

“Meow?” (Can I first attempt to fuse and then decide how many to exchange?)

“Of course.” Xu Ran gave a smile, then opened the recycling interface and placed the pre-selected skills and battle instinct together.

[★★Battle Instinct]+[★★Tyrannical Body] + [★★Blade Will]

[Fusion success rate: 7.2%

[Proceed with fusion?]

[Yes][No]

Three skills fused!

This was a venture Xu Ran had never embarked on before, but he speculated that this method of fusion was actually more efficient than fusing skills in pairs.

Because taking into consideration the compatibility of multiple skills at once was more reliable than considering the compatibility of single skills.

Regardless of whether it was the two-star skill Tantamount Body or the two-star skill Blade Will, the individual fusion probability with Battle Instinct wasn’t high. However, when they were combined with Battle Instinct, the probability was much higher than other combinations.

Though this required painstaking trial and comparison, it was all worth it to raise the skill ceiling!

The fusion began!

One stone… two stones… three stones…

As the success rate steadily rose, Xu Ran’s heart pounded more rapidly until…

[Fusion success]

[★★★Battle Body (Waning Moon Level)](o/2ooo)[ + ]

Xu Ran let out a sigh of relief.

It took nine stones – he had been fairly lucky this time too.

Ziyun, having felt the confines of his ability being shattered once again, couldn’t help but widen his eyes in surprise and delight.

Everything was ready!

All four three-star skills had reached the Waning Moon level, entirely fulfilling the evolution conditions for the Flash Thunder Cat!

“Nine were used, should we continue by fusing Self-healing Power?” Xu Ran turned to the joyous Ziyun and asked.

“Meow!” (Continue!)

Xu Ran nodded in agreement and continued exchanging skills.

Fuse them!

Success on the first try?

Xu Ran was stunned as he turned to the expectant Ziyun, “Only one was used, three are left.”

“Xi Lu!” (My turn! My turn!)

Star couldn’t help but interpose.

Since Big Sister’s needed skill fusion was complete, the remaining three might just be enough for his own fusion, right?

He couldn’t help but glance somewhat longingly at the Insightful Eye skill listed on the small blackboard.

This skill had been hanging on the board for more than a week, it was about time to fuse it, wasn’t it?

“Meow-” (Give them to Star!)

Despite the fact that Blood fury hadn’t been upgraded, Ziyun knew when to stop pushing their luck. Reveling in the novelty of the two new skills, she was overjoyed.

Xu Ran nodded and then began Star’s skill fusion.

[★★Insightful Eye]+[**Night Eyes]

[Fusion success rate: 9.2%]

[Proceed with fusion?]

[Yes][No]

Fuse them now!

After seing the success message appear after the third fusion, Xu Ran smacked his hands together in satisfaction.

“Perfect, all the skill fusion stones have been used.”

“Xi Lu!” (Is this what skill fusion feels like?)

Star crowed.

At that moment, he felt like he was celebrating the New Year.

“All that’s left to distribute are physical points and Beast Master Points,” Xu Ran glanced at a zoned out Ziyun and reminded with a smile, “Ziyun, you still have 4386 Value Points left, but owe 1535.”

“Meow!” (Pay it off!)

Ziyun swished her tail grandly.

I, Ziyun, pay my debts!

Ultimately, after consulting each other, the two pet beasts decided to split the physical points evenly and exchange the rest for their individual Beast Master Points.

Ziyun:

Growth Step: Elite Stage (6712 / 20000)[+]

Ul

Growth Step: Elite Stage (79541 20000)[+]

Star:

Growth Step: Elite Stage (6521 / 20000)[+]

Ul

Growth Step: Elite Stage (7763 / 20000)[+]

Xu Ran nodded slightly, cleaned up the used resources on the little blackboard and left the last three lines.

“Skill Fragment: 4 pieces (Star)”

“Energy Abundant Potion: 2 bottles (Star)”

“Beast Master Points: 1609 (Ziyun) + 6793 (Star)”

With a grand sweeping gesture, he circled the three lines of characters and looked at the two pet beasts, whose strength had skyrocketed in a short period of time, an ambitious flame ignited in his chest.

“Familiarize yourself with your respective powers, prepare to leave the city!”

“Meow!” (We’re off!)

Excitement gleamed in Ziyun’s eyes.

Evolution! Here I come!
