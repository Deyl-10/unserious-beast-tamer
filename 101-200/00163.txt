“Meow!” (I’ve evolved successfully!)

With the destruction of the two big and small lizards, Ziyun, who was originally still aggressive, with an overbearing aura and pressure like a ruler of the world, instantly reverted back to its innocent and cute appearance.

Ziyun originally grew to a length of one and a half meters after breaking through the elite stage. After evolution, instead of increasing, it reduced to just about one meter now.

Its chubby figure and fluffy tail lend it a juvenile look as if it has regressed from adolescence back to childhood after advancing.

This way, Ziyun could easily crawl into Xu Ran’s arms for a cuddle.

But, Ziyun’s dramatic change in appearance compared to before, and the significantly stronger momentum, all proved that it had successfully completed its evolution, crossing the first threshold of transformation.

From a Leader Species, it had evolved into a King Species!

“Well done!” A smile appeared on Xu Ran’s face as he reached out his hands to catch Ziyun who had leapt towards him, examining it carefully.

Purple flames still burned on Ziyun’s front paws until now, occasionally sparking an electric arc around the edge of the flames, looking quite threatening.

Just now, it was such a paw that easily annihilated the two big and small lizards.

But when Xu Ran touched it with his hand, he only felt a light numbness, not uncomfortable at all, and it was even somewhat pleasant.

Of course, these were not the main point.

Xu Ran opened Ziyun’s stats panel without hesitation.

“Hiss?? ”

Reading through it, Xu Ran couldn’t help but take a cold breath.

Compared with Ziyun’s previous stats, this time, the changes were drastic.

Firstly, it was the progress bar next to the growth stage.

Usually, the upper limit of the progress bar at the elite stage should be 20000 points. However, now it had turned into 30000 points.

This was the upper limit of the progress bar!

Xu Ran was very clear about what this represented.

This meant that King Species, even at the same growth stage, had a higher upper limit than Leader Species, and could reach a strength that Leader Species couldn’t achieve.

Besides that, the surge in Ziyun’s growth progress also surprised Xu Ran.

It shot up from less than eight thousand to over twenty thousand in one go. The progress brought on by evolution far exceeded his expectations and was much more efficient than adding points.

No wonder that strong lizard could not last a single round against Ziyun just now.

Apart from the growth stage, the changes in Ziyun’s skills are the most significant after evolution. @@novelbin@@

According to Gu Wu’s previous words, during the evolution process, the original talents of the pet beast would be upgraded, evolving into more powerful talents.

However, Ziyun’s talent did not evolve from three stars to four stars…

Well, actually, Xu Ran had anticipated this situation.

Gu Wu had mentioned before that a large part of the difficulty in evolution lay in the upgrade of talent skills. Hence, the easier it is for a pet beast’s talent skills to upgrade, the lower the difficulty of evolution.

Following this theory, if the skills are upgraded to the next star level prior to evolution, the difficulty of evolution would be significantly reduced.

This could be one of the considerations for the evolution path given by the system. The prerequisite that all talent skills must reach three stars could be understood as completing some steps that would normally take place during evolution in advance.

This was something that other people could not do. Only Xu Ran, with his skill fusion stones that could enhance the star levels of skills through skill fusion, could do it.

The negative side effect of completing part of the evolution steps in advance was naturally that the skills that were supposed to be upgraded during evolution no longer got upgraded.

Although there was no anticipated star upgrade, the changes in skills were still significant.

Firstly, there was the additional three-star skill, one that every King Species possessed, symbolic of the King Species – the King’s Power.

Together with the original four three-star skills, Ziyun now had a total of five three-star skills.

The original four three-star skills also had not remained the same, and the name of two skills had changed.

The original Annihilatory Thunder Palm had changed to Destruction Thunder Claw, and the original Battle Body had become Fighting Body.

Xu Ran did not believe that this was as simple as just changing a skill name.

So…

“Ziyun, perform Destruction Thunder Claw!” Xu Ran pointed at a large stone not far away and instructed.

“Meow-” (Sure!)

Ziyun nodded, flashed, and came to the front of the huge stone. The flame on its raised paw turned dark and dangerous.

As its paw touched the stone, a strong force exploded instantly, turning the hard stone into flying ash in the blink of an eye, much to the astonishment of both Xu Ran and Star.

The attack Ziyun used just now against the two lizards was this skill indeed!
