Chapter 432: Chapter 265: Cancan’s Social Death and Earth Raccoon’s Gratitude (Two-in-One)_2

Yesterday, encountering the other party outside the city, it was mortified to see them again at this moment.

Damn it… I was one step too slow!

“Hmm?” Seeing Cancan’s unusual behavior, Xu Ran’s brows slightly raised.

This doesn’t look like it doesn’t have anything to do with me…

With that thought, Xu Ran suddenly remembered that the Ground Raccoon Tribe left the shop for the city outskirts yesterday around the same time Cancan and Star were returning from there.

So…

“What happened at the end of business yesterday?”

“Chaa?!” (How did you know?!)@@novelbin@@

Upon hearing Xu Ran’s inquiry, Cancan’s golden eyes couldn’t help but widen a bit.

I didn’t say anything! How did Xu Ran guess?

Seeing Cancan like this, Xu Ran felt sure of the situation and turned to look at Star, who couldn’t bear to look directly at Cancan.

“Xi Lu~” (This is what happened…)

Realizing that there was no fooling Xu Ran, Star shook its head, then quickly relayed the encounter with the Ground Raccoon Tribe on the way back yesterday, and how Cancan scared them off and even wanted to chase after them to give them another scare.

After hearing this, both Xu Ran and Ziyun, who had been watching the drama, revealed a peculiar look.

Cancan, this little fellow… really let loose outside the city.

“Alright Cancan, apologize to them!” Now knowing the crux of the matter, Xu Ran said with a mix of amusement and annoyance.

“Chaa~” (Sorry~)

Cancan blinked its eyes and dutifully approached the Ground Raccoon Clan Leader, speaking softly.

“Loo~”

No harm done.

Now aware of the situation, the Ground Raccoon Clan Leader waved its paw with a slightly bewildered motion.

It was the first time it had ever received an apology from a being of the General stage.

In that moment, the Ground Raccoon Clan Leader grew fonder of the Starfire Foster Care Shop.

“Loo!”

Returning the favor, it waved its paw at the Ground Raccoons waiting inside for the Washing and Protection Service, signaling them to queue up properly and behave.

The fluffy Ground Raccoons quickly lined up in a long queue, each stepping forward to place the Luminous Soil Stones they had prepared on the counter, and then waited for Xu Ran to provide the Washing and Protection Service. This scene appeared rather amusing.

Seeing this, the three little ones knew that their help was no longer needed in the shop, so they went upstairs together, heading to their respective Training Areas for a new day of training.

“Now, let’s get started.” Taking a deep breath, Xu Ran patted the Ground Raccoon standing at the front of the line, signaling it to follow.

A person and an animal entered the Washing and Protection room, and soon after, the strange sounds of a Ground Raccoon could be heard from inside.

“Loo~~~”

—————–

“Splash—”

“Clang—”

A series of crashing sounds faintly emanated from the tightly shut doors of the Universe Foster Store.

Inside the shop, the staff watched in silence as Liu Yu continued smashing things, unsure of what to do.

After a while, Liu Yu finally stopped his actions, gasping for air. He carefully placed his favorite ceramic vase back on the table and pointed at the various pieces of paper and plastic products scattered on the ground, “Clean this up.”

“Yes.” A staff member quickly stepped forward and began tidily picking up the mess on the floor.

“Boss, what do we do now?” A young man among the staff, who appeared to be higher in rank, approached Liu Yu with a worried look on his face, “Are we really going to follow through with the bet?”

“If we do, our Universe Foster Store’s customer base will gradually be taken by them…”

“I know!” Liu Yu massaged his throbbing temples, “But with so many people watching, if I reneged right there, the reputation of the Universe Foster Store would be completely ruined!”

Thinking of Liu Fengyun, who had stood in the crowd enjoying the spectacle and then casually hit him where it hurt, a shadow crossed Liu Yu’s eyes.

These outsider foster stores really are all tough customers.

He had no doubt that if he had not honored his word at that moment, Liu Fengyun would have tripped him up and spread the incident throughout Monster Wooden City, destroying the reputation of the Universe Foster Store.

Therefore, his declaration to honor the bet at the time was truly a last resort.

Thinking of the consequences of fulfilling the bet, Liu Yu couldn’t help but want to slap himself.

If only I hadn’t bet in the first place, none of this would have happened.

If only…

Taking a deep breath, Liu Yu tried to regain his usual composure, “Zhang Tianhe.”

“I’m here.” The higher-ranking young man responded gravely, “What do you need, boss?”

“First, cancel all Washing and Protection Services of the Universe Foster Store,” Liu Yu’s voice paused briefly, “And repurpose the washing rooms accordingly.”

“As if the Universe Foster Store never had Washing and Protection Services to begin with.”

“…Okay!” Zhang Tianhe pondered for a moment, then nodded firmly.

He now understood the intention behind Liu Yu’s actions.

Currently, only a few are aware of this matter.

Moreover, since the Washing and Protection Services of the Universe Foster Store hadn’t been around for long, the majority of customers were also unaware of it.

Since the bet stipulated that the Universe Foster Store would no longer engage in Washing and Protection, they might as well go with the flow and completely erase any trace of the Universe Foster Store’s Washing and Protection services.

With this approach, they could retain as many previous customers as possible.

Surely the boss, even at such a critical juncture, could come up with the best damage control plan!

“Secondly…” Liu Yu’s voice stopped again, a chill flickering in his eyes, “Put up a notice outside the door of our Universe Foster Store.”
