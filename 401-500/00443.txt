Chapter 443: Chapter 268: Public Wash and Care Exhibition! Undercurrents Surge!_3

“Please enlighten me, everyone.” Zhou Hang said with a polite smile, then turned on the megaphone in his hand, “Ladies and gentlemen! Beast friends from Monster Wooden Domain! Hello, everyone!”

As his voice, amplified by the megaphone, echoed throughout the Central Square of Modu Main Road, more and more people and beasts turned their attention to the area and converged towards it.

Liu Fengyun and the other thirteen foster shop owners exchanged glances and silently left the stage.

The next two hours, the stage belonged to Qi Cang and his Gray Wolf Foster Store.

“There is no need for everyone to stay here all the time.” Liu Fengyun said with a smile after stepping down from the stage, looking at the other thirteen foster shop owners including Xu Ran, “I have already informed you of your times in advance, just make sure to come back before the designated time starts.”

However, after Liu Fengyun finished speaking, no one present seemed inclined to leave.

“Boss Liu must be joking,” laughed one owner with a goatee, stroking his smooth beard, “How could we miss such a rare opportunity to exchange washing and protection techniques with everyone?”

“Our Shengtian Pet Foster Care has specifically suspended business for today’s event, so we could take this chance to learn washing and protection techniques from our peers.”

“Same here!”

After this foster shop owner finished speaking, many others laughed and joined in the chorus.

Clearly, they all shared the same idea.

“Meow?” (Are we also staying?)

Ziyun leaned in close to Xu Ran and asked quietly.

“Yes.” Xu Ran nodded, his face filled with anticipation, “I plan to stay as well to see the washing methods of other foster shops.”

His washing techniques were taught by the system, which definitely differed from those of other foster shops in this world.

Now that he had his own insights into the Washing and Protection methods, observing and learning from the techniques of other foster shops was an opportunity to broaden his knowledge.

This was also one of the reasons he had agreed to Liu Fengyun’s invitation.

Seeing the three little ones looking hesitant, Xu Ran knew what they were thinking. “You three go back to the shop and train. You don’t need to stay with me all the time.”

“If I need you for anything, I will summon you in advance.”

“Chah!” (Okay!)

Cancan nodded vigorously, excitement twinkling in its eyes.

“Of course, you can only train back at the shop. We’re not discussing going out of the city,” Xu Ran quickly added, squashing the adventurous Cancan’s little schemes.

“Chah…” (Alright then…)

The light in Cancan’s eyes dimmed.

It had become an explorer without a dream.

“Alright.” Xu Ran smiled helplessly, “After today’s event is over, I will take you out of the city to have a look tomorrow.”

It had been a few days since Cancan and Star last sneaked out for an adventure.

Were it not for this unexpected event, Xu Ran might have taken them out of the city the day before to check out the place Cancan had discovered.

So, as soon as this event concluded, it would be time to schedule a city outing.

“Chah!” (Yay!)

Cancan’s mood swung like a roller coaster, brightening up again in an instant.

Ziyun and Cancan climbed onto Star’s back, the three little ones nodded at Xu Ran, and then vanished from sight.

As Xu Ran’s gaze shifted from the leaving backs of the three little ones and returned to the stage, an expectant look appeared on his face.

After the host’s brief opening remarks and introduction of the event rules, the first contestant had already taken the stage.@@novelbin@@

It was a Beast Master, his slightly stiff demeanor suggesting he had never before allowed his Pet Beast to receive foster shop care.

“Sir, in these months since Mystical Wood Dew has ceased to appear, how have you helped your Pet Beast with body cleaning?”

“Um… washed with a tap?”

“But your Pet Beast is a Fire Attribute Pet Beast.”

Amid a few queries that drew laughter from the bystanders, Qi Cang approached the customer with a face that, though wild-looking, now held a reassuring expression, “Please rest assured and hand over your Pet Beast to me, I’ll make it as good as new.”

“Okay…okay.”

The Beast Master nodded, and behind him, the Hexagram Star Array lit up. Amidst the gusting winds, a monkey covered in flames appeared before the crowd.

Fire Attribute Transcendent Stage Leader Species, Little Flame Monkey.

Compared to a healthy, well-built Little Flame Monkey, the flames around this one were noticeably less vibrant, and its color was somewhat dim. It was visibly not in great condition.

“Hmm… Please follow me!” After circling around the Little Flame Monkey to assess its condition, Qi Cang clearly had a plan for its care, and confidently pointed to the washing station, gesturing for the Little Flame Monkey and its Beast Master to follow.

Before long, the Little Flame Monkey was placed on the washing station, and Qi Cang began his preparation for the washing care.

Below the stage, the foster shop owners, under Liu Fengyun’s guidance, had found good viewing seats and were engrossed in observing Qi Cang’s preparation details while also engaging in discussions.

“That Little Flame Monkey just now looked in rough shape, this is not going to be an easy cleaning job. I wonder if Mr. Qi can handle it.”

“I feel like if that Little Flame Monkey was handed over to me, I’d struggle a bit. I hope I won’t encounter such a difficult washing subject when it’s my turn.”

“Haha, who knows?”
