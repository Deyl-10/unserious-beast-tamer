Chapter 441: Chapter 268: Public Wash and Care Exhibition! Undercurrents Surge!

“`

A day’s time, neither fast nor slow.

Amid the eager anticipation of the fifteen foster care store owners, the agreed-upon Public Wash and Care Exhibition officially began.

Early in the morning, the fifteen owners gathered at the prearranged location.

For the vast majority of them, this was their first meeting since arriving in Monster Wooden City.

For a time, compliments such as “I’ve long admired your reputation” were exchanged warmly, and no one showed the slightest disdain towards Xu Ran, the youngest amongst them.

After all, the clash between the local and foreign foster shops had started with him.

Word of the conflict between Starfire Foster and Universe Foster Store had spread to some extent, so everyone was well aware that this seemingly youthful man possessed impressive Washing and Protection skills.

A brief and friendly conversation also allowed Xu Ran to get acquainted with the others.

The foster care shop owners before him hailed from over ten Second Level Towns, covering almost all of the Second Level Towns in Beast Field No. 47.

Considering the possibility of opening branches in their cities in the future, Xu Ran was also keen on establishing good relations with them.

“Alright,” Liu Fengyun said with a smile, noticing that it was about time, “the rest can wait until after the public grooming event is over.”

“Let’s go, our event site is almost ready. Let’s see if it meets your Washing and Protection requirements.”

At his words, the chatter ceased, and everyone’s face lit up with interest.

The primary concern for everyone participating in the Public Wash and Care Exhibition was whether their Washing and Protection requirements would be satisfied.

After all, each had their own methods of grooming, necessitating various materials and tools.

There’s an old saying, “A good chef can’t cook without rice.”

If the necessary items for their Washing and Protection methods were not available, the effectiveness of the public demonstration would certainly be impacted.

Attending this event was all about showcasing the before and after effects of their grooming skills to gain more Fame and customers for their stores.

If anything went awry, the event could backfire, not only failing to increase Fame and clients but potentially causing existing customers to drift away.

Liu Fengyun, of course, had taken their concerns into consideration.

Thus, he had once again visited each foster shop owner the day before, asking for a list of their Washing and Protection needs to organize and set up everything himself.

Now that all the essentials were arranged, he confidently invited the other fourteen owners to have a look.

“Great!” A burly man with a full beard laughed heartily, “Boss Liu is indeed highly efficient!”

Qi Cang, the owner of the Gray Wolf Foster Store, came from King Dragon City, a Second Level Town.@@novelbin@@

“Since that’s the case, let’s all go take a look together,” commented another elegant woman in a form-fitting long dress, smiling gently.

Du Huayan, the owner of Hundred Flowers Foster Store, came from Bright Radiance City, another Second Level Town.

The other foster care shop owners also agreed and followed Liu Fengyun’s lead into the heart of the Monster Wooden Marketplace.

The marketplace was just opening for the morning and already bustling with activity.

The lively atmosphere differed from what Xu Ran had experienced on his last visit.

Perhaps due to it being breakfast time, many stalls were selling morning-friendly food, with lines not only of Humans but also a few early-rising Transcendent Beings.

Xu Ran even spotted a Little Night Mink queuing at a stall.

This Dark Extraordinary Creature, a nocturnal being that slept during the day, appeared to be drowsy, probably planning to sleep after the meal.

So… for it, was this a late-night snack?

The thought brought a smile to Xu Ran’s face.

As he was looking around and enjoying this other side of the morning market, a savory breeze brought a lunch box in front of him.

“Boss Xu, this is yours,” Du Huayan said, placing the lunch box in Xu Ran’s hands before handing another one to another foster care shop owner nearby.

“Thank you, Du!” Xu Ran came back to his senses and quickly thanked her, then opened the lunch box.

Inside, there was food from one of the stalls they had just passed.

It appeared that Du Huayan had bought breakfast for herself and had thoughtfully included the others.

Despite having already eaten, Xu Ran had no intention of wasting her kindness.

“Come, let’s all try some,” Xu Ran said with a smile, using the bamboo skewers from the lunch box to share the delicious food with the three little ones beside him.

By the time the lunch box was empty, the group had reached the most central and bustling area of the Monster Wooden Marketplace.

Sky-touching Main Road.

They were in the middle of Sky-touching Main Road, which was the heart of the marketplace.

At this location was a sizable open-air plaza, now temporarily rented out, with a huge stage set up.

The stage was concealed, keeping it hidden from the eyes of onlookers, who were curiously gathered around, eager to see what was inside.

“Boss Liu, why the secrecy?” bellowed Qi Cang with his booming voice, “Isn’t this supposed to be a public grooming event?”
