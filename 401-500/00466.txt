Chapter 466: 274 Nightmare, Thrilling Part 4

Chapter 466: Chapter 274 Nightmare, Thrilling Part 4

The terrifying sound of thunder made the breathing of the white cat with heterochromatic eyes more and more rapid, its chest and abdomen strained with convulsive movements, its body curling even tighter.

But those eyes, already narrowed to pinpoints, remained fixed on the sky above, where the traces of lightning were slowly fading.

It’s that!

The white cat with heterochromatic eyes realized.

The one that had killed its companion was the thunderbolt exploding in the sky!

At that moment, immense fear engulfed its heart.

This was something it could not understand, a power that earth and sky could not resist.

But it knew that such power, which could easily take away its companion’s life, could just as easily take away its own life.

It gathered its long tail a little closer, hugged it tightly to its chest, and couldn’t help letting out a series of soft whimpers.

Flashes of electric light and thunderous sounds echoed time and again.

Then, the sound of pouring rain arose, “whalala,” and a torrential downpour crashed down.

This was a sudden thunderstorm.

Letting the icy rainwater flood over its hiding corner, soaking its body, the white cat with heterochromatic eyes curled up anxiously, daring not to move an inch, its body violently trembling with every peal of thunder.

Once… twice…

No idea how long had passed, the rain began to subside, and the dark clouds dispersed.

The gentle sunlight sprinkled down, illuminating the city ravaged by the thunderstorm, and also soothing the frightened hearts of every creature.

The body of the white cat with heterochromatic eyes, now somewhat stiffened, gave a slight twitch.

Its long fur completely drenched, it appeared somewhat gaunt as it clung to its body.

Staying curled up for so long made its body stiff.

It took a good while for the white cat with heterochromatic eyes to recover, it stepped out from the only corner that offered a sense of security during the thunderstorm, shook the water off its body, and then sneezed several times in a row.

It walked silently to where the body of its companion lay still in the middle of the road, looking at the charred body twisted into a ghastly position, fear once again rising in its eyes, and after a good while, let out a low wail.

“Meow~”

The next moment, its body shook violently.

In confusion, came a bit of clarity.

That’s not right!

This is a memory from the past!

It’s Ziyun!

At this moment, it’s in the midst of a nightmare!

Vividly recalling itself and the current situation clearly, a robust will to fight emerged in the white cat with heterochromatic eyes.

It had long accepted the tragic memories of the past and overcame its fears.

It no longer feared lightning, at this moment, it was the master of thunderbolts!

The scenery around hadn’t changed, but Ziyun’s form began to subtly transform.

It was no longer the pitiable stray cat, soaked by the downpour, it had regained its rightful body and power.

A nightmare, that’s all it was!

Ziyun’s eyes gleamed with a touch of pride.

Memories can’t bring it down!

However, the next moment, its expression stiffened slightly.

Because the scene around it, after it had returned to its original form, also began to undergo earth-shattering changes.

Xu Ran, Star, and Cancan appeared before its eyes.

And in front of them appeared a terrifying creature, its form indistinct but with an overwhelmingly vast presence, giving Ziyun a feeling of irresistible dread.

Before Ziyun could react, Xu Ran and the other two were utterly devoured by a boundless thunderbolt, leaving only Ziyun, staring in shock.

“…Meow?!”

—————–

That was the companion it played with most closely when facing other stray cats, they would always fight shoulder to shoulder, and it would bring back any food they scavenged to share with each other.

And now, the other had lost its life, transformed into something the cat completely did not recognize.

It couldn’t understand why, just walking down this street they had tread countless times before its companion, things turned out this way.

The white cat with heterochromatic eyes slowly backed away, trying hard to curl even tighter in the corner it had already reached.

Gazing at the scorched corpse of its companion nearby, occasional Electric Arcs sprung up from the ground. Its ears, long tufts of fur and all, were now pushed forcefully back, flat against the back of its head, while its slightly parted mouth panted continuously.

A blinding flash of Thunderbolt streaked across its field of vision.

The next moment, the same explosive sound as before once again filled the air.

“BOOM!!!!”

The terrifying Thunderous Sound made the breathing of the cat with heterochromia even more rapid, its chest and abdomen struggling to contract, its body curling tighter.

Yet its eyes, now constricted to pinpoints, remained fixated on the fading traces of electricity in the sky above.

It was that!

The cat with heterochromia realized.

It was the Thunderbolts bursting in the sky that had killed its companion!

At that moment, immense fear clung to its heart.

This was a force beyond its comprehension, a Power the heavens and earth couldn’t resist.

But it knew, such Power, capable of easily claiming its companion’s life, could just as easily claim its own.

It drew its long tail in closer, hiding it desperately in its embrace, unable to stop emitting faint meows of distress.

Flashes of Light and Thunderous Sounds echoed back and forth, repeatedly.

Soon after, the “whooshing” sound of rain started, and a downpour crashed down abruptly.

This was a sudden Thunderstorm.

Despite the chilling rain flooding its hidden corner, soaking its body, the cat with heterochromia curled up tensely, not daring to move an inch. With every peal of Thunder, its body would tremble violently.

Once…twice…

Time passed indeterminably, and eventually, the rain lessened and the clouds dispersed.

Sunlight gently fell, illuminating the city ravaged by the storm and simultaneously soothing the frightened hearts of every creature.

The cat with heterochromia’s now stiff body twitched slightly.

Its long fur, completely drenched, clung to its shrunken frame.

The prolonged curling made its body stiff.@@novelbin@@

After a good while, the cat with heterochromia started to recover, stepping out of the corner that had been its only source of security during the storm, shaking the water off its fur, and then sneezing several times consecutively.

It walked silently up to its companion’s body lying still in the middle of the road, looked at the charred corpse frozen in a grotesque pose, and fear surged in its eyes once again. It took quite a while before it let out a low meow of mourning.

“Meow~”

The next moment, its body trembled violently.

In bewilderment, it gained a bit more clarity.

Something was wrong!

This was a memory from its past!

It was Ziyun!

It was in the midst of a nightmare!

Vividly remembering itself and understanding the current situation, a rich fighting spirit emerged in the cat with heterochromia’s eyes.

It had already come to terms with its miserable memories from the past and had even overcome its own fears.

No longer afraid of Thunderbolts, it was now a master of Lightning!

The scenery around it hadn’t changed, but the form of Ziyun began to subtly transform.

It was no longer the pitiful Stray Cat soaked by the storm; it had returned to its original, powerful body and strength.

The nightmare was nothing more than this!

A sense of pride gleamed in Ziyun’s eyes.

Memories were not enough to defeat it!

However, the next moment, its expression stiffened slightly.

Because the surroundings, upon the restoration of its original form, began to undergo a drastic change.

Xu Ran, Star, and Cancan appeared before it.

And before them emerged an indiscernible entity of immense scope and invincible presence, eliciting from Ziyun a sense of inescapable dread.

Before Ziyun could react, Xu Ran and the other two were engulfed by a boundless surge of Thunderbolts, leaving Ziyun staring agape.

“…Meow?!”
