Chapter 456: Chapter 272: The Unusual New Resident_2

The heavens are fair: with such power gained, as a price, the three-tailed demonic leopard’s fur cannot even be penetrated by its own water attribute power.

This leads to the situation where the dirt in their fur cannot be thoroughly cleaned by themselves.

Over time, the three-tailed demonic leopard would start to feel uncomfortable all over.

The three-tailed demonic leopard in front of them was in this exact predicament.

But for Xu Ran, this wasn’t a problem at all.

If water can’t be used to wash and protect the fur, then other methods could be employed.

A sand bath was an excellent choice.

“Follow me,” Xu Ran indicated the door to the Washing and Protection room and gestured for the three-tailed demonic leopard to follow him. Then he glanced at the young man with dark circles under his eyes, “Are you coming?”

“Yes!” The young man with dark circles nodded emphatically, a look of expectation in his eyes, “I heard your washing process is pretty unconventional, and I want to see it!”

Very unconventional washing process…

Xu Ran’s mouth twitched slightly, “Where did you hear that?”

“Everyone says so,” chuckled the young man with dark circles, “Come on, Boss Xu, stop hiding it—what exactly did you do before running a Foster Shop?”

Xu Ran pretended not to hear and quickened his pace, swiftly taking the pet and its owner into the Washing and Protection room.

At this point, the young man with dark circles had no more time to pay attention to Xu Ran’s previous occupation. Inside, the indoor space was even more significant, and the luxurious complete washing facilities took his breath away.

He had been at the Public Wash and Care Exhibition yesterday.

While observing the Foster Shops showcasing their spectacular washing processes, the young man with dark circles also noticed the various washing equipment on stage.

That kind of washing equipment looked very professional; it was impressive and daunting.

Now, seeing a washing room much more luxurious than the one from the day before, his eyes lit up instantly.

In such circumstances yesterday, Boss Xu managed to perform such a challenging wash for a pet that Mystical Wood Dew could not clean. Today, in a better environment, Xu Ran’s skills should be even better, right?

Thinking this, the young man with dark circles didn’t care about anything else. He quickly grabbed a small stool, sat down, and watched Xu Ran’s washing process with bated breath.

Unconcerned with his first client’s rich inner drama, Xu Ran quickly ground various resources into uniform fine particles for bath sand, starting the first Wash and Protection of the day.

Soon, a combination of pleased and slightly strange sounds came from the three-tailed demonic leopard within the Washing and Protection room.

“Welcome to come again~”

Standing outside the Foster Shop, Xu Ran’s smile had become somewhat stiff.

In just a morning, he had served over ten clients.

Even though he tried his best, the number of clients he could accommodate was still meager compared to the long queue outside the door.

Fortunately, the waiting clients seemed to notice this as well.

Realizing they had no hope of being served today, they gradually dispersed, planning to come back tomorrow or at another later time.

Thus, with noon arriving, only a few figures persisted in the queue outside.

“Welcome…” As Xu Ran’s gaze caught a glimpse of the next client approaching, he was about to greet the customer with practiced ease when he recognized the person’s face. His words halted abruptly, and his smile became more animated, “Tutu, you’re here too.”

“Yeah!” Seeing Xu Ran again, Li Tutu’s face was full of excitement, “Mr. Xu, I saw your entire washing process yesterday!”

“You’re amazing! I was almost nervous to death when the Exquisite Flower King went on stage, but I didn’t expect you to be able to wash a pet that even the Beast Emperor couldn’t.”

“It’s just that Mystical Wood Dew couldn’t wash it. The Beast Emperor himself would definitely be more amazing.” Xu Ran smiled modestly, “So, you’ve come for a wash, too?”

“Yes!” Li Tutu nodded vigorously, following Xu Ran into the store, he soon saw the Price Menu hanging on the wall.

He chuckled, scratching his head with a somewhat goofy expression, “Luckily, my Pet Beast is a small one. That means I can save quite a bit of Money!”@@novelbin@@

As he spoke, a small hamster with dark golden fur and no bigger than a palm poked its head out of a pocket on his chest.

Carefully cupping his hands together, Li Tutu lifted the small hamster out of the pocket and smiled at Xu Ran, “Mr. Xu, this is my Pet Beast.”

“Golden Whisker Mouse.” Xu Ran nodded slightly.

He didn’t need a System Identification to recognize this Earth attribute Pet Beast, which was small and high in aesthetic value.

Unlike the usual Earth attribute Pet Beasts with large Body Types, strong Defense, and wide attack range, the Golden Whisker Mouse was known for its agility and strong exploration Skills.

As an elite race, it had four Talent Skills, two of which were exploration-type, one movement-type skill, and only one attack-type skill, which wasn’t very strong.

Such characteristics made it more of a support role in Pet Beast teams.

To his surprise, Li Tutu had chosen such a Pet Beast as his first.

“Jin, let’s go together for the Washing and Protection,” Li Tutu stated, recognizing the origin of his own pet. Cradling Jin carefully, he followed Xu Ran into the Washing and Protection room.

Noticing this, Xu Ran’s brow rose slightly.

Why did he feel… Li Tutu’s attitude towards his Pet Beast was a bit odd?
