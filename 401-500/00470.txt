Chapter 470: Chapter 275: The Dragon’s Skeleton, Thunder Dragon Stone_4

Accompanied by the voice, a small furball emerged from the rear of the Guardian.

Looking at the light purple eyes and the flexible tentacles on top of its head, Xu Ran’s face showed an extra measure of surprise and astonishment, “Sleep Demon group?!”

With just a glance, he had determined that this Sleep Demon in front of him was the same one he had previously washed during a public Washing and Protection session.

However, what was it doing here?

Wait a second…

Xu Ran looked at the Sleep Demon, then at the Guardian with its large body and strong strength.

Although the two had quite different appearances, there were still many common characteristics to find.

So… was this Guardian an evolutionary form of the Sleep Demon?

Then what was the relationship between this Sleep Demon and it…

Before Xu Ran could continue pondering, the Guardian issued a low sound.

“Lulu~”

At the same time, the meaning corresponding to its voice appeared in the minds of the human and his three Pet Beasts.

(Have you also come for the Thunder Dragon Stone?)

“Thunder Dragon Stone?” Xu Ran couldn’t help but glance at a certain side of the Rock Wall; he could sense that the magnificent Power of the Thunder Attribute was behind that part of the wall, “What is that?”

Although Xu Ran had already learned about many Transcendent Resources, such resources were still just the tip of the iceberg in the transcendental world.@@novelbin@@

This Thunder Dragon Stone mentioned by the Guardian before him was unknown to him.

As Xu Ran expressed his doubt, the three little ones also showed a look of confusion on their faces.

Clearly, they had never heard of such a resource either.

“Esteemed predecessor, we sensed underground Thunderous Sounds, so we wanted to take a look and weren’t aware of any Thunder Dragon Stone,” Xu Ran hesitated for a moment, then thickened his skin and smiled, “Since we’re here already, may we take the Thunder Dragon Stone with us?”

The Guardian glanced at Xu Ran.

Then, a thoughtful look appeared in its eyes as if it were considering and weighing something.

Eventually, the Guardian spoke again in a deep tone.

“Lulu~ Lulu~”

(The Thunder Dragon Stone is a Transcendent Resource of the Overlord stage, formed from the leaking Power of the Thunder Attribute that coalesced after an Overlord stage Thunder God Silent Dragon fell here, leaving its corpse behind.)

(That Thunder God Silent Dragon showed me great kindness, so I am here to guard its corpse.)

(In regard of the Washing and Protection you provided for my child, I can allow you to take away one piece of the Thunder Dragon Stone.)

(But…)

The voice paused slightly, and the Guardian’s eyes grew sharper.

“Lulu~”

(You may only take away a single piece, and you must not damage its corpse.)

“No problem!”

Xu Ran spoke without hesitation.

Before arriving here, he had already prepared himself to return safely, even if it meant coming back empty-handed.

Now that he heard the Guardian before him agree to let him take away a piece of the so-called Thunder Dragon Stone, he was too delighted to care about anything else.

After all, from the description, it was an Overlord level Thunder Attribute Transcendent Resource.

Such a resource would be a tremendous uplift for Ziyun.

Ziyun was just at the crucial point of evolving into an Emperor Species, and this resource came just at the right time.

Thinking this, Xu Ran’s gaze towards the Sleep Demon was suddenly filled with goodwill.

The system’s statement was correct after all; the Sleep Demon really could bring him good luck.

This good fortune might not refer to the Dream Weaving Silkworm Silk from before.

It probably referred to this very encounter.

“Lulu~”

(Follow me.)

After a glance at the human and his three Pet Beasts, the Guardian turned and headed towards the direction of the Thunderous Sounds; the Rock Wall in front of it cracked open, revealing a dazzling purple Thunder Light inside the Cave.

A dragon-class super creature corpse, over a hundred meters long and remarkably well-preserved, with a fierce and domineering appearance, lay quietly on the other side of the large cave.

Nearby, on the rock wall and the ground, grew prism-shaped purple crystals, like naturally formed crystals.

These purple crystals contained immense power, with golden dragon-shaped lightning constantly crashing against the surface of the crystals, making a buzzing sound like thunder.

The thunderous sound that reached outside the cave was the collective resonance of the sounds emitted from these purple crystals.

“Lulu~”

(These purple ones are all Thunder Dragon Stones, pick one.)

The Guardian spoke calmly and then stood at the entrance of the cave, watching the human and his three pet beasts.

Xu Ran took a deep breath and, after exchanging glances with the three little ones, slowly stepped forward.

Under his lead, the human and three pet beasts first respectfully bowed slightly to the fallen dragon corpse before starting to quietly make their selection.

This detail filled the Guardian’s eyes with a hint of goodwill.

In its heart, it made a silent decision.

Seeing that this human and his pet beasts showed such respect for the Thunder God Silent Dragon, which had bestowed grace upon itself, the Guardian decided that if they didn’t pick a sufficiently good Thunder Dragon Stone, it would give them one from its own treasured collection.

Completely unaware that their small gesture had won them such a favorable impression, Xu Ran and the three little ones huddled together and soon carefully extracted a Thunder Dragon Stone about one meter in length.

In the smooth crystal surface of the Thunder Dragon Stone, the golden dragon-shaped thunder made Ziyun’s eyes light up instantaneously.

It could feel that the purple crystal wasn’t anything particularly precious; what was truly valuable was the golden dragon-shaped thunder sealed within it.

Such thunder, formed from the pooled power of the Thunder God Silent Dragon before them, was different from ordinary thunder.

To absorb it would bring about unimaginable improvements!

However…

Ziyun turned its head to look at the other Thunder Dragon Stones surrounding them.

It knew that it was not yet the time to make a choice.

Since they could only take one, it had to be the very best!

“Let’s go look somewhere else,” Xu Ran said with a smile, guessing from Ziyun’s expression what it was thinking, and then carefully placed the Thunder Dragon Stone back in its original position.

Together, the human and three pet beasts continued searching and quickly found another Thunder Dragon Stone of roughly the same size.

They put it down and searched again.

Xu Ran soon realized this was quite inefficient.

After all, there were thousands of Thunder Dragon Stones of various sizes within the cave.

“Let’s split up and search,” he said to the three little ones, making a decisive call.

The three little ones also understood that searching separately was more efficient, nodded their heads, and without hesitation divided up and searched in four different directions.

Before long, Cancan’s somewhat excited voice echoed in the cave.

“Cha!” (This one’s so big!)

Xu Ran and the other two little ones looked immediately, quickly seeing Cancan carefully holding a Thunder Dragon Stone and nodding in indication.

And that Thunder Dragon Stone was two meters long.

The golden dragon-shaped thunder inside was dazzling.

“Very nice!” Xu Ran gave Cancan a thumbs up from a distance, “Everyone keep looking! If we don’t find a better one, we’ll choose Cancan’s!”

Ziyun and Star nodded their heads, not to be outdone, and began their search.

Soon, Ziyun also found a Thunder Dragon Stone that was roughly two meters in length.

Meanwhile, Star’s gaze settled on a somewhat special Thunder Dragon Stone amidst a cluster of others.

This Thunder Dragon Stone didn’t display any golden dragon-shaped thunder.

Its color also wasn’t as clear, appearing somewhat murky.

It looked as though something existed within it, but Star couldn’t see clearly.

After only a moment of hesitation, Star carefully hoisted this special Thunder Dragon Stone onto its back and turned to walk toward Xu Ran.

It had decided on that one!

To bring it back for Xu Ran to see!
