Chapter 465: Chapter 274 Nightmare, Thrilling_3

The distance of five kilometers was now almost half covered.

As they drew ever closer to the Thunderous Land, they also neared the protective range of the Guardian.

“Meow~” (Steady on!)

The black light in Ziyun’s eyes deepened a shade.

Since Cancan was in a state of descent, its head was at the lowest point.

And Ziyun, who clung to Cancan’s single horn, naturally became the one closest to the bottom.

It had to ensure that the first to enter the enemy’s defense range, was itself!

Cancan did not respond, but the speed of descent remained stable.

Two kilometers… three kilometers… four kilometers!

The closer they got to the ground below, the thunderous sounds, barely perceptible only to Cancan earlier, could now be faintly heard by all three pets and their owner!

“Boom~ Boom~”

The deep thunder roared like the shout of the thunder god, echoing in the depths of the earth for a long time, accompanied by a humming noise and the light, continuous tremors emanating from the earth!

It was as if the divine thunder, belonging to the heavens, had been trapped deep within the earth and enraged completely!

There really was thunder!

Excitement lit up the eyes of the four companions.

Especially for Ziyun, with its Thunder Attribute.@@novelbin@@

Upon hearing that thunder, it instinctively felt a power calling to it from even deeper below.

This was the mutual attraction between Thunder Attribute forces!

At this moment, it could confirm that the power below definitely belonged to the Thunder Attribute, and its energy was not weak!

At the very least, it was no less than the King Stage level resources!

However, in the next instant, the expressions of all four companions changed abruptly.

Almost at the same time, they sensed an invisible force surging towards them, which was quite formidable, and far exceeded the upper limit of the General Level.

It was… Power of the King Stage level!

The force crashed heavily against the Star Refusal Ring that Starlight had activated early on, and the twinkling starlight around it seemed to have entered an invisible mill, swiftly dimming.

“Xi Lu~”

Starlight was shocked and enraged, the starlight at the tip of its single horn shining to the extreme in the pitch-black depth of the earth, standing out prominently. It exerted all its own and Xu Ran’s power to try to fend off the opposing force.

Their first contact lasted only an instant.

Realizing that this intruder was not as easy to deal with as expected, the invisible force paused for a moment, and then actually retracted.

This…

The owner and three pets were slightly taken aback.

Before they could react, an even more powerful force swept over them like a tidal wave!

That power…

All four of them went pale simultaneously.

If the previous force was of the King Stage level, then the current one already had elements that surpassed that level.

It may not have reached the Overlord Stage, but it was similar to the Nightmare Beast King, having already exceeded the limits of the King Stage!

And unlike the previous force, this one seemed to possess a unique quality, such that the Star Refusal Ring, which Starlight struggled to maintain, had no effect on it!

“Meow~” (Face death!)

Ziyun was the first to react, the pitch-black color in its eyes instantly spreading out, nearly turning its heterochromatic eyes completely black.

An extreme sense of danger emerged from around it at that moment.

However, in the next instant, its body suddenly stiffened, the black light also dispersing in a flash, and the expression in its eyes began to dissipate.

A hint of struggle appeared in the depths of Ziyun’s eyes, yet against the opponent at hand, its resistance seemed rather futile.

In just a moment, Ziyun, who had entered the range first, had its consciousness dragged into a nightmare.

Cancan followed closely behind.

Then came Xu Ran and Starlight.

Cancan’s massive body was like an ark traveling beneath the earth, and at this moment, that ark seemed to have hit a rock, its forward momentum rapidly halting.

Only the faintly pulsating Earth Attribute Power instinctively encircled the owner and three pets, maintaining their ability to dive underground.

The depths of the earth quietened down.

Only the continuous thunder, which seemed to never cease, faintly emerged, not stopping for a long time.

—————–

“Boom!!!”

A streak of lightning, like a long spear piercing the earth, traced a bright fissure in the void, then ferociously struck the ground.

“Meow!!!”

With a piercing cry, a small cat covered in somewhat dirty white fur, with beautiful heterochromatic eyes, huddled fearfully in the corner of the street.

Its wide eyes stared at the center of the road, where the figure was burnt black beyond recognition.

It was its closest playmate, with whom it had always fought side by side against other stray cats, sharing any scraps of food they managed to scavenge together.

And now, its friend had lost its life and was transformed into something utterly unrecognizable.

The white cat with different colored eyes didn’t understand why, having just walked this street they had traversed countless times before its friend, everything had changed so drastically.

The bicolor-eyed white cat retreated a little, trying to curl even tighter into the corner it had already reached.

Looking at the vicinity of its companion’s charred body, where electric arcs sporadically shot from the ground, its ears, with their long tufts of fur, were completely folded back against its head, and its slightly open mouth panted continuously.

A blinding bolt of lightning streaked across its field of vision.

The next moment, the same deafening roar as before sounded again.

“Boom!!!”
