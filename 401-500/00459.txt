Chapter 459: Chapter 273 The Warning of the Earth Raccoon

Xu Ran didn’t have to wait too long; the Combat Badger, which looked famished, had already gobbled up all the food in its bowl, leaving it spotlessly clean.

Even when Xu Ran came forward to clean up, it obediently handed over its empty bowl.

From its lingering look and its earlier eager actions, Xu Ran could tell that it really liked the food he had prepared.

“From now on, consider this place your home and stay well,” Xu Ran smiled at the somewhat special Combat Badger, took the bowl, and turned to leave.

Consider it home…

Watching Xu Ran’s departing figure, a contemplative look appeared in the eyes of the Combat Badger.

The recently digested food provided it with an abundance of energy and, feeling as if it had endless vitality, the Combat Badger abandoned its contemplation.

It dashed back to its living area, making “squeak squeak” noises along the way and soon stirred up a great commotion in its living space.

However, the commotion quickly subsided.

The Combat Badger seemed to have sensed the noise and its somewhat silly-looking eyes swiftly became more piercing; it quickly turned its head and looked towards the elevator leading to the other floors with a wariness.

There stood three little ones who had just finished their training and were now descending the stairs together, making a detour to the second floor.

Having held little hope for the new resident’s arrival, they were all visibly shocked when they first noticed the change in the foster area.

“Meow?” (A new neighbor?)

Ziyun curiously tiptoed, peering towards the Combat Badger’s foster area.

Thanks to its familiarity with the foster area, it recognized at first glance that this living space seemed to be crafted for Fighting Pet Beasts.

So… the first resident in the Monster Wooden City shop is a Fighting Pet Beast?

Thinking this, Ziyun’s gaze sharpened slightly.

It had already spotted the other party.

“Xi Lu~” (That looks like a Combat Badger.)

Star, who had also noticed the Combat Badger, let out a neigh, a hint of realization flashing in its eyes.

Having seen this species before at the Starfire Foster Care Shop in Xieyun City, it had quickly recognized it.

“Cha!” (It seems quite alert.)

Cancan lifted a paw and scratched its head, speaking tentatively.

“Meow~” (Let’s go, let’s check it out.)@@novelbin@@

Ziyun, with its tail held high, led the way with its graceful cat steps, moving swiftly yet silently, and in just a few breaths, it was already in front of the Combat Badger.

“Meow~” (Welcome to your new home~)

The Combat Badger, initially tense due to sensing the aura of three General Stage Pet Beasts, gradually relaxed.

It seemed the others were friendly?

The sharpness in its eyes was replaced once more with a silly expression.

“Squeak?” (Are you also foster residents here?)

Faced with the Combat Badger’s inquiry, laughter appeared in the eyes of the three little ones.

“Cha!” (We aren’t fostered, we are the pet beasts of the shop owner!)

Cancan shook its head, its eyes gleaming with a touch of pride, quickly answering first.

That human?

A shock flashed through the Combat Badger’s mind.

No wonder it had faintly felt a threatening power emanating from that human, enough to endanger itself.

As a General Level Beast Master, even without summoning his Pet Beasts, the strength of the human alone would be sufficient to subdue it.

With this thought, the Combat Badger became even more timid.

After taking another look at the three little ones, the Combat Badger suddenly asked.

“Squeak?” (Do you ever have conflicts with your Beast Master?)

—————–

“Welcome back anytime~”

At the entrance of the Starfire Foster Shop, Xu Ran saw off another satisfied customer, who couldn’t stop praising his service, the smile on his face growing even more content.

The business in the afternoon was no less impressive than in the morning.

If anything, it was even better.

In just half a day, there had already been new customers referred by those who visited in the morning, indicative of the rapidly spreading good reputation of Starfire Foster.

Although there was no second fostering customer yet, and no one had tried the accompanying training service, all business was still concentrated on Washing and Protection. Xu Ran believed that the day when all services bloomed was not too far off.

Glancing at the sky, which was gradually darkening, Xu Ran couldn’t help stretching himself.

“Almost time to end today’s business,” Xu Ran muttered, then looked towards the three little ones whose expressions obviously became expectant.

Clearly, they were all looking forward to the outing planned for after closing time.

The trip to a place outside of Monster Wooden City, searching for that special spot that Cancan had discovered last time in the Monster Wooden Domain.

However, before Xu Ran could close the shop door, a young man with a look of urgency hastily stepped into the store.

“Excuse me… have you seen a Combat Badger?”

While speaking, the young man gestured through the air, “About this tall… this big… with a simple and honest expression.”

Xu Ran, initially bewildered, gradually took on a strange expression upon hearing the young man’s description.

Because what the young man described seemed to be the very Combat Badger he had fostered in his shop earlier that day.

“Are you… looking for it for a reason?” After a moment of silence, Xu Ran asked slowly.

“It’s really here!” The young man lit up when he noticed that Xu Ran did not immediately deny it, but instead posed a question back to him, “I had just heard that it made its way to this block, and I’ve been asking around the shops!”
