Chapter 469: Chapter 275: The Dragon’s Skeleton, Thunder Dragon Stone_3

“`

“Looby~”

The little furball gently touched the powerful being with its tentacles, its eyes filled with a hint of pleading.

“`

The powerful creature’s eyes were full of displeasure, but after making eye contact with the little furball, it shook its head helplessly.

“Lulu~”

Well, fine… but if they want to take what I’m guarding, it won’t be easy.

With a casual wave of its hand, the four mirrors in front of it shattered and dissipated.

On the other side, a person and three pets, who couldn’t wake up from their respective dreamscapes, opened their eyes at the same moment.

“Is everyone okay?” Shaking off the dreamscape at the first opportunity, Xu Ran’s gaze immediately fell on the three little ones who were gradually coming to their senses.@@novelbin@@

In Ziyun’s eyes, there was still some residual madness and fierce killing intent, suggesting that the previous nightmare had quite an effect.

Star’s mood seemed a bit down, apparently not yet completely free from the nightmare.

But as for Cancan…

Xu Ran looked at Cancan, who seemed to have just woken up from sleep, with a more puzzled expression in his eyes.

What had this guy experienced in the nightmare?

“Meow~” (I’m fine.)

Having come to its senses, Ziyun shook its head slightly, eyes tinged with a trace of fear.

In the second layer of the nightmare, it had watched helplessly as the thunderbolt being, far beyond its match, killed Xu Ran and the other two pets instantaneously, plunging it into madness and triggering the Divine Punishment for a desperate fight.

Now awake, the first thing it did was to check its own condition, thankfully finding no traces of having used the Divine Punishment.

In other words, it didn’t have to endure the pain of the Divine Punishment a second time.

But…

The memory of seeing its companions being killed in the dream, yet being powerless to help, infused Ziyun’s eyes with a hint of anger and unwillingness.

What if such a day actually comes in the future?

At that thought, Ziyun suddenly felt a strong sense of urgency.

It was only at the General stage now, still far too weak.

It had to evolve as soon as possible!

“Xi Lu~” (I’m fine too.)

Star whinnied softly, giving a slight shake of its head.

In the second layer of the dreamscape, it was partially lucid, aware that it was all a nightmare.

But, faced with companions it couldn’t touch, it had still abandoned its original rationality, foolishly chasing after them.

Thinking about this, Star couldn’t help but sigh to itself.

It looked like it needed to become calmer, huh~

“Cha~” (Slept quite well~)

Cancan shook its large head, its face still displaying a bit of confusion.

And its distinct reaction also caused Xu Ran and the other two pets’ expressions to turn peculiar.

“Xi Lu?” (Should we continue forward?)

Star asked with a whinny.

Hearing this, Xu Ran’s expression became contemplative.

At this moment, he was uncertain about the hidden Guardian’s intentions.

No doubt, the simultaneous escape from the nightmare was orchestrated by the other party.

So, was the purpose to warn them, or…

But one thing Xu Ran was clear on.

The Guardian’s strength surpassed their expectations, and even with Star’s Star Refusal Ring, they couldn’t resist its power.

Thus, continuing deeper with an unclear stance from the Guardian obviously posed an undeniable threat.

While the person and three pets hesitated, a subtle and invisible fluctuation, carried on the thunderous sound, spread towards them.

At the instant this non-aggressive fluctuation touched the person and three pets, a thought arose in their minds.

It was an invitation.

From that hidden, powerful Guardian.

The Guardian wanted to meet them.

The three pets exchanged glances, then looked toward Xu Ran.

“Let’s go see,” Xu Ran hesitated for a moment, then spoke without hesitation.

If the other party had wanted to harm them, they had had numerous opportunities a moment ago.

So, this shouldn’t be too dangerous for them.

“Thinking positively, maybe after talking with the Guardian, it might be willing to give us the thing from the Thunderous Land,” Xu Ran said jokingly, trying to lighten the somewhat tense atmosphere.

With Xu Ran’s decision made, the three pets no longer hesitated.

Cancan shook its head; it no longer needed to preserve its strength for fear of startling the enemy. Its earthy-hued energy spread to the surroundings, quickly pinpointing a hidden cave deep in the ground and swiftly moving towards it.

Before long, Cancan led Xu Ran and the other two pets through the rock wall and into the spacious cavern.

In the cavern, the unceasing thunderous sound echoing proved its proximity to the Thunderous Land.

However, at this moment, the person and the three pets were no longer concerned about the Thunderous Land.

Their gaze unanimously fixed on a creature inside the cavern, about fourteen meters tall, with sturdy limbs, four tentacles atop its head, and eyes of a deep purplish-black filled with strange light.

Judging by the strength of its aura, the person and three pets could easily determine that this was the Guardian guarding the Thunderous Land, whose power faintly exceeded the limits of the King Stage and was the one who had acted against them just now.

Although the Guardian had voluntarily backed off, feeling its crushing power at this moment still made Xu Ran and the three pets tighten up, not daring to let their guard down.

And then, at that moment, a somewhat familiar, cheerful voice echoed in the empty cavern.

“Looby~”
