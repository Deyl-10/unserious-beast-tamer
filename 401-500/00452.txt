Chapter 452: Chapter 270: The Reborn Exquisite Flower King!_4

“All right, let’s go back,” the owner of the Foster Shop where the Exquisite Flower King had originally been staying said, shaking his head slightly, “Now that it has come to this, we’ll have to truly fight them in this business war.”

“If we lose, we’ll just have to give up the Washing and Protection Service and return to our original fostering and accompanying training business to protect our own small patch.”

A sigh went up from the crowd as they followed him and left the venue.

But the same question echoed in everyone’s mind.

By giving up the Washing and Protection Service, could they really protect their small patch?

If other foster shops from outside the area provided such good Washing and Protection Service, wouldn’t their fostering and accompanying training service be inferior?

—————–

“We have half an hour left for Starfire Foster’s operation, so please welcome the next guest!”

Amid the fervor of the announcer’s voice, there was some commotion at the entrance.

Xu Ran looked over with anticipation.

Who… would his second guest be?

As he awaited with expected eyes, the curtain that had been drawn was lifted, and a rotund Transcendent Being appeared, striding on its two short legs onto the stage.

It was covered with layers of long, dense, purple fur, with only two small light purple eyes peeking out, blinking at Xu Ran, and it said hello to Xu Ran by shaking the two distinctive feelers on top of its head, as it had no hands.

There was no Beast Master by its side, and the unique aura of a wild Transcendent Being made its origins quite clear.

This was a Transcendent Being from the Monster Wooden Domain!

Suddenly, quiet whispers spread among the audience below.

Even the Transcendent Beings curiously watching from the crowd showed surprised and bewildered expressions.

Compared to humans, wild Transcendent Beings were less receptive to Washing and Protection.

In the wild Transcendent Beings’ world, there was a more defined hierarchical order, which engendered blind worship of the Beast Emperor Sky-touching Mysterious Wood in their hearts.@@novelbin@@

Although this event was for both human Beast Masters and wild Transcendent Beings, since the morning, no wild Transcendent Being had come on stage—all who did were human Beast Masters.

This one in front of them was the first wild Transcendent Being to attempt the Washing and Protection Service at this event.

While the audience was surprised, Xu Ran also made a System Identification to learn about this guest in front of him.

[Race name: Sleep Demon

Attribute: Super ability

Growth Step: Elite Stage

Body type: Small size

Washing and Protection requirement: ★★★☆☆

Evaluation: A Transcendent Being that symbolizes luck and sleep, if the host gives it a pleasurable Washing and Protection experience with skillful hands, something unexpected might happen~]

Symbolizing luck and sleep?

Xu Ran paused for a moment, taking a closer look at the Transcendent Being in front of him.

This was the first time the system provided such a special reference.

And the last line of the evaluation was particularly surprising to Xu Ran.

Although the system’s evaluations were always less than serious, putting aside that frivolous content, the occasional gems of insight it provided were always important.

It seemed this Transcendent Being in front of him was quite special.

With that thought, Xu Ran immediately perked up with great interest.

“Welcome here, to receive my Washing and Protection.” He gave his brightest smile, pointing to a small-sized Washing and Protection table nearby, “Please follow me there for the bathing.”

“Looby~”

The Sleep Demon responded, touching the tips of its two feelers together in the air, as if a shy little one extended two index fingers and poked them together shyly, despite its lack of hands.

Under Xu Ran’s guidance, the Sleep Demon cooperatively lay down on the Washing and Protection table, waiting for him to complete the preparations for the cleansing.

Soon, the Washing and Protection officially began.

With the warm water flowing from the showerhead, it moistened the Sleep Demon’s body evenly, running down from the tips of its slightly rough fur to the roots, then passing around the follicles, and finally merging into a light grey stream, the Sleep Demon’s eyes revealed a look of contentment.

Compared to the previous Exquisite Flower King, the Washing and Protection process for the Sleep Demon seemed much more routine.

After completing the initial wetting, Xu Ran applied whipped nourishing shampoo to his hands, spreading it evenly over the Sleep Demon, then began to rub and massage.

With his kneading, the shampoo permeated evenly to the roots of the fur, and every inch of the hair follicles gently trembled under such meticulous massaging.

However, this time, Xu Ran felt as if something was missing during the Washing and Protection.

Usually by this point, the Pet Beast undergoing Washing and Protection would have already been making strange sounds, accompanied by uncontrollable light tremors.

Whereas the Sleep Demon at the moment…

Under Xu Ran’s massage, it actually closed its tiny eyes and fell into a deep sleep, breathing deeply.

“This…”

A strange expression appeared on Xu Ran’s face.

Could it be that this fellow… gets tired more easily?

With this thought, Xu Ran couldn’t help but increase the strength of his massaging.

You must make a noise for me today!

—————–

“Phew…”

Xu Ran took a deep breath, a look of exhaustion on his face.

Washing and Protecting this Sleep Demon felt more tiring than washing the Exquisite Flower King before.

No matter how much he increased the strength of his Washing and Protection, the Sleep Demon slept so sweetly, even starting to snore at the end.

In the end, Xu Ran simply had to give up on the idea of applying more force and, following the standard Washing and Protection procedure, methodically completed a full set of Washing and Protection and maintenance work.

Just when Xu Ran was blow-drying its fur, thinking that this guy would continue to sleep soundly on the table, the Sleep Demon that had slept through the entire washing process opened its little eyes, got up from the Washing and Protection table, and hopped down lively from the table.

“You…” Xu Ran opened his mouth, “How do you feel?”

“Looby?”

The Sleep Demon moved to the large mirror set up to inspect the results of the Washing and Protection, and saw itself, its fur smooth as silk and shimmering with an incredibly supple luster in the sunlight, a satisfied look in its eyes.

“Looby!”

Clearly, it was satisfied with Xu Ran’s Washing and Protection results.

“Glad to hear it,” Xu Ran nodded, but his mind recalled the evaluation from the system during the previous identification.

Washing this Sleep Demon would lead to an unexpected event?

So… what could that event be?

With this thought, he couldn’t help but look towards the Sleep Demon.

“Looby!”

The Sleep Demon, just awakened, now fully alert while admiring its new look, had become completely refreshed.

Having always loved cleanliness and after the Mystical Wood Dew ceased production, it was finally able to wash itself clean again!

Having been watching the scene for quite a while now, it knew that the time had come to reward this human!

To reward someone was to give them something valuable from oneself…

A contemplative look appeared in the Sleep Demon’s eyes, and it quickly thought of something, waddling over to the reward box.

It just so happened to have something it couldn’t use itself; in that case, it might as well give it to the human in front of it as a token of gratitude!

“Looby~”

The Sleep Demon called out and then, from who knows where, produced a small clump of crystal-clear material, placing it in the reward box before waddling off the stage.

“Huh?”

Seeing the clump of material, Xu Ran suddenly exclaimed in surprise.

Could this be…

Dream Weaving Silkworm Silk?!
