Chapter 453: 271: Tearless Sorrow Of The Twelve

Chapter 453: Chapter 271: Tearless Sorrow of the Twelve

Gently lifting up the bundle of tender silk which seemed almost insubstantial, each strand delicate and translucent, sparkling with a strange rainbow luster under the sunlight, Xu Ran confirmed his judgment.

This was the rarely seen super ability attribute resource, Dream Weaving Silkworm Silk.

And for Xu Ran, it held a special purpose.

That was as one of the main materials for the Twelve Evolution.

Although he hadn’t formed a contract with Twelve yet and couldn’t keep Twelve by his side, Xu Ran had long considered it as his Pet Beast, always on the lookout for evolution resources for it.

Besides the auxiliary materials that were easy to obtain, there were three main evolution materials for Twelve.

Dreamer’s Shadow, Superpower-tier King Level Blood Essence, and Dream Weaving Silkworm Silk.

The first type of resource could be exchanged in Xieyun City, costing only four or five thousand Beast Master Points, so Xu Ran had already exchanged it in advance for Twelve.

The second resource could also be exchanged in Xieyun City, and after learning about Twelve’s father’s identity, it seemed there might be an even better way to obtain it…

But only the third type of resource, Dream Weaving Silkworm Silk, was not available for exchange in either Qingzhou City or Xieyun City.

It wasn’t because of its high value, but simply because it was rare and obscure.

Fortunately, Xu Ran had already checked its description and pictorial information in Xieyun City, so once he encountered Dream Weaving Silkworm Silk, he could identify it at first glance to avoid missing out on a treasure right under his nose.

And now, his thorough preparation evidently paid off.

“Are you really going to give me this resource?” Xu Ran couldn’t help but turn to look at the Sleep Demon beside him, who was trying hard to keep its little eyes wide open, looking quite adorable. “This is Dream Weaving Silkworm Silk, very rare.”

“Looby~”

The Sleep Demon nodded its head, giving Xu Ran a confirming gaze.

As a super ability attribute Pet Beast, it certainly knew what this resource was.

But… is this thing rare?

The Sleep Demon tilted its head, showing a slightly puzzled expression.

Isn’t this the silk spun daily by the little pets it was raising?

Watching the human in front of it cherish the Dream Weaving Silkworm Silk and treat it like a treasure, the Sleep Demon’s face showed a disdainful expression as if to say “you haven’t seen the world.”

The tentacles on its head shook, signaling that the gift was his, then it wobbled away from the scene.

Oblivious that he had been scorned by his special guest just then, Xu Ran chuckled and carefully stored the silkworm silk away, while the host’s voice echoed through the venue.

“Congratulations to Boss Xu for receiving the transcendent resource gifted by a guest!”

“After professional evaluation, this resource is worth 500 Beast Master Points. According to the rules of this event, congratulations to Boss Xu for receiving a reward of five hundred thousand Yuan!”

With the host’s announcement ringing out, gasps of amazement spread throughout the audience.

Just this one resource had already exceeded the total rewards of the previous four Foster Shops!

But given Xu Ran’s Washing and Protection performance earlier, the audience felt it was well-deserved.

After all, not just anyone could complete the Washing and Protection for a transcendent being that even Mystical Wood Dew couldn’t entirely cleanse!

“Thank you, everyone,” Xu Ran said, his face also wearing a satisfied smile.

Now, it seemed there was a good chance he would win the title of most popular Foster Shop of the event.

And what mattered even more was…

Xu Ran touched the Dream Weaving Silkworm Silk he had tucked away in his pocket.

He had found the last piece of the evolution resources for Twelve.

Now, all that was left was to bring Twelve back.@@novelbin@@

Behind Xu Ran, the Hexagram Star Array flashed; Ziyun emerged from the Wind and exchanged a glance with Xu Ran, both human and pet brimming with anticipation.

Soon, very soon!

—————–

“Achoo!”

In area number 97, the core zone of the Beast Field controlled by the Nightmare Beast King, Twelve suddenly sneezed, then rubbed its beak with its plump wings and looked in a certain direction, a trace of confusion in its eyes.

With the extraordinary sixth sense of a super ability attribute Pet Beast, Twelve could feel that the source of its sneeze was vaguely coming from that direction.

But, that direction didn’t seem to be Xieyun City.

Could it not be Xu Ran and the others?

Then who else could it be?

After much thought, Twelve gave up pondering. After all, the location it faintly sensed was even farther away than Xieyun City.

Lazily lying in its nest on the tree branch, which was made from the softest fur of transcendent beings, Twelve flipped over to expose its round belly to the sun, letting the light filter through the leaves and cast spots on it.

Gazing at the diffuse light mist in the sky, Twelve’s sea-blue eyes gradually glazed over.

“Chirp~” (So boring~)

It had been nearly a week since its father brought it back.

At the moment, it remained under house arrest.

Although Twelve couldn’t see its father’s subordinates around, it knew that once it left the nest beyond a certain distance, they would appear and follow right behind it, never leaving its side.

So aside from eating and sleeping, there didn’t seem to be much else for Twelve to do.

Although… before slipping away from the Beast Field core area and secretly mixing into the human city, Twelve had spent every day like this.

But longing for the diverse experiences of the human city, Twelve had now become a bird with higher aspirations!

It wanted to earn money through its own capability as before, and then buy all sorts of delicious foods it liked!

With this thought, Twelve couldn’t help but sigh.
