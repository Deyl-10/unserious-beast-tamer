Hearing what the two workers had to say, Xu Ran momentarily felt as if he had misheard.

Quickly realizing what they meant, a look of amusement mixed with exasperation appeared on his face, “Gentlemen, the actual situation is not like that.”

“Please, tell us. We are here today to understand what’s going on,” said one of the workers in a quite friendly manner, taking out pen and paper and preparing to take notes.

“You both should know that if a Pet Beast wishes to leave with its Beast Master, I absolutely cannot stop it,” Xu Ran spread his hands, “After all, the other party only needs to summon their Pet Beast to take it away.”

“I’m just an ordinary Foster Shop owner, with no power to intercept someone else’s summoning.”

Upon hearing this, the two Association workers exchanged a glance.

Indeed, this was the biggest mystery in the case.

“So what exactly happened?” another worker couldn’t help but ask further.

“Here’s what happened,” Xu Ran paused for a moment to organize his thoughts before continuing, “That Combat Badger showed up at our shop by itself yesterday noon, offering an item as payment for foster care, requesting to be fostered.”

As he saw the workers’ expressions turn odd, Xu Ran spread his hands, “It is indeed a bit bizarre, I was also surprised at the time.”

“At first, I thought it was a wild Transcendent Being.”

“The one who pays the money is a customer,” Xu Ran spoke calmly, “As a shop owner, serving my own customers and preparing an appropriate fostering environment for them is only reasonable, right?”

Hearing Xu Ran’s question, the two workers nodded subconsciously.

There really wasn’t anything wrong with this.

“Then what about Mr. Kang Cheng’s complaint that you prevented him from meeting his Pet Beast?” the lead worker paused his rapid note-taking to inquire.

“Well,” Xu Ran’s expression took on a hint of innocence, “since the Combat Badger paid to be fostered here, it became a resident of our shop.”

“If someone wants to visit a resident of our shop, it’s only proper for me as the owner to ask whether it wishes to meet them or not,” Xu Ran paused slightly, “The Combat Badger did not wish to see the other party, even if he was its own Beast Master.”

At this point, the expressions of the workers from the Association became somewhat more serious.

They exchanged looks, and then the worker who had followed toe gave a low hum, “Kang Cheng, after assuring us so solemnly at the Association that he would treat the Combat Badger well, now he has done such a thing!”

Both were no fools; considering the fact that the Combat Badger could not be summoned away by Kang Cheng, it was clear who was more credible.

So, after comparing the statements of Kang Cheng and Xu Ran, they quickly formed their own judgment on the matter.

Clearly, Kang Cheng did something unpleasant to the Combat Badger; otherwise, a Pet Beast that was usually easy to get along with wouldn’t have done something like this.

“An unequivocal promise?” Hearing the worker’s words, Xu Ran’s face showed a touch of curiosity, “What’s that about?”

He had originally thought that the matter was simply a case of a Beast Master named Kang Cheng mistreating the Combat Badger, leading to the pet’s flight from home.

Now it seemed that the story was more complicated than he had imagined, wasn’t it?

How could there be involvement from the Beast Master Association in a Beast Tamer Contract Pet Beast?

“It’s a bit complicated,” the lead worker replied to Xu Ran’s inquiry without concealment, his expression filled with a trace of melancholy, “To put it simply, Kang Cheng wasn’t the Combat Badger’s original Beast Master.”

“The Combat Badger’s original Beast Master?” Hearing this, Xu Ran’s expression grew even more astounded.

“Has passed away.” The other worker spoke with a voice slightly heavy with sadness, “The Combat Badger’s first Beast Master, though not a worker with our Beast Master Association, was a very enthusiastic and kindhearted person.”

“He had assisted our Association’s work on many occasions, only to perish in an accident while trying to save others.”

“This…” Hearing this, Xu Ran couldn’t help but grow solemn, inwardly feeling a pang of regret for the Beast Master he had never met.

“The biggest wish of that Beast Master before his departure was for his Pet Beast to be well cared for,” the worker’s eyes reddened slightly, “He was only an Elite Stage Beast Master, and one of his Pet Beasts even perished in that accident with him.”

“What remained was only the Combat Badger.”

“We, the Beast Master Association, took this matter very seriously and took the Combat Badger in, searching for a sufficiently outstanding Beast Master to entrust with it.”

“How did it end up with Kang Cheng?” Xu Ran frowned slightly.

That guy, he didn’t seem like an outstanding Beast Master, did he?

After hearing the story of the Combat Badger’s previous Beast Master, he even felt that Kang Cheng didn’t deserve to make a contract with the Combat Badger.

“The reasons are complex,” the worker replied with a wry smile, “During the inspection by our Beast Master Association, Kang Cheng performed very well in various aspects.”

“Plus, he has some connections in the Beast Master Association, and many people spoke well of him.”

“So… the Association ultimately decided to entrust him with the Combat Badger.”

“And what about the Combat Badger’s own opinion?” Xu Ran couldn’t help but ask.

The Pet Beast’s contract can’t be enforced by the Association, can it?
