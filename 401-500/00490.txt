Chapter 490 - 280: Xu Ran's Special Training Method_4

"There are still a few Pet Beasts living there at this moment, one of which is familiar with the Combat Badger," Xu Zhou's voice paused slightly, "During their interaction with the Combat Badger, they heard about its description of Starfire Foster Care Shop."

"After that... they too showed a strong desire to come to Starfire Foster Care Shop," Xu Zhou's face took on a somewhat helpless smile.

In the Association's foster area, they lived quite well, and everyone treated them fairly. Why did each and every one of them think about running off?

"Ah, this..." After hearing Xu Zhou's explanation, Xu Ran's expression also turned odd.

He never expected that the Combat Badger, after a visit back to the Beast Master Association, would actually start advertising for Starfire Foster Care Shop.

"If the Association doesn't mind, our shop is very keen to welcome them," Xu Ran said without hesitation.

This was a great opportunity that he had to seize.

"Not just these few Pet Beasts, in the future, if the Association has other Pet Beasts without a Beast Master that need temporary fostering, they can all be sent to Starfire Foster Care Shop. Our shop will do everything possible to create a warm and comfortable living environment for them."

Not only that, considering that the Association takes in Pet Beasts without a Beast Master for charitable reasons, our shop can offer a 50% discount to the Association, charging only half the foster care fee for all Pet Beasts."

"Boss Xu, you..." Hearing Xu Ran's earnest words, Zhou Rong and Xu Zhou were both moved, "Doing this, you'll lose a lot of money."

"Money is an external possession," Xu Ran gestured dismissively, putting on an indifferent front, "Although I am just a foster shop owner, I also have a kind heart. Being able to help the Association is a great honor for me."

"Considering that the Association's staff is limited, there might be a problem managing too many ownerless Pet Beasts, I have another small request," Xu Ran's voice paused again, a hint of earnestness in his eyes.

"I hope the Association can issue a certificate for our shop, stating that our shop is the designated foster for ownerless Pet Beasts recognized by the Association. This way, when new ownerless Pet Beasts appear in Demon Wood City, they can come directly to my shop, saving the Association a lot of work."

"This!!!" Zhou Rong's eyes widened, filled with emotion, "Boss Xu, you are really too kind!"

At that moment, he couldn't help but think of the Combat Badger's first Beast Master.

That person also did their best to cooperate and assist the work of the Beast Master Association, even sacrificing their young life in the process.

And now, this young man in front of him was also showing such enthusiasm.

No wonder the Combat Badger liked to stay in this foster shop; perhaps... there was a reason like this behind it.

"Boss Xu, the Association is fortunate to have someone with your dedication," Zhou Rong made a decisive statement, "Please wait, I will go back and ask for instructions right away."

"Once the Association agrees, the certificate will be sent to your shop immediately, and the ownerless Pet Beasts, including the Combat Badger, will subsequently all be entrusted to Starfire Foster Care Shop."

Having said that, Zhou Rong, along with Xu Zhou, turned and left the Starfire Foster Care Shop without hesitation, leaving Xu Ran with a smile on his face.

"Perfect!" Watching the two leave, Xu Ran's smile deepened, "Once the certificate is hung on the wall, the customers coming in and out for Washing and Protection will definitely be more interested in trying out the store's Foster Care Service."

"Moreover, this is indeed an honor for the foster shop," Xu Ran clapped his hands, his face showing a relaxed expression.

The foster shops in Demon Wood City were different from those in Xieyun City.

The business at Starfire Foster Care Shop here had become booming in a very short period of time, but it was booming only in terms of Washing and Protection; Foster Care and Accompanying Training services were neglected.

This was related to the background of Demon Wood City itself, and also because Starfire Foster Care Shop had never properly demonstrated the results of Foster Care and Accompanying Training.

For Xu Ran, all three services were obviously important.

Therefore, Xu Ran had also thought about using some methods to let the customers of the Foster Shop learn more about the other services.

After all, they were related to the acquisition of Skill Fragments, Physical Points, and Skill Points, respectively; just offering the Washing and Protection service was not a satisfactory state.

Therefore, Xu Ran had also thought about using some methods to let the customers of the Foster Shop learn more about the other services.

However, those methods had little effect.

After all, the price for Washing and Protection in Demon Wood City was high, making the prices at Starfire Foster Care Shop seem cheap in comparison, but for Foster Care and Accompanying Training, the prices in Demon Wood City were not much different from those in other cities. @@novelbin@@

Therefore, the prices of Starfire Foster Shop seemed quite expensive.

Now, if they could get an endorsement from the Beast Master Association, it would clearly be a great boon for the business expansion of Starfire Foster Shop.

If nothing unexpected happened, the number of foster residents would soon increase, and with more fostering, the accompanying training service could also be improved by some means.

Physical points and skill points, aren't they on their way?

With his hands clasped behind his head, Xu Ran wore a pleased expression on his face and couldn't help but let out a light laugh.

However, the noise from the elevator soon interrupted his daydreaming.

As the elevator doors opened, Du Tan, who looked amazed, walked out with a Healing Mushroom that appeared somewhat exhausted, as if its energy had been drained.

They had only bought one hour of accompanying training time today, and now, that hour had passed.

"Do you need to extend the time?" Xu Ran asked with a smile.

"Not for now, I still have to go to class later," Du Tan shook his head, then his expression turned to one of admiration, "Boss Xu, the accompanying training service at your shop is really incredible! Next time, I will definitely bring the Healing Mushroom here again!"

"Always welcome," Xu Ran smiled, watching the boy and his pet depart.

After leaving the Starfire Foster Care Shop, Du Tan quickly returned to his school with his Healing Mushroom.

Demon Wood City Sixty-third Beastmaster Middle School, commonly known as Sixty-three Middle.

Upon entering his class, Du Tan immediately walked up to a boy sitting in the corner and slapped his shoulder vigorously.

"Tutu, the foster shop you recommended is amazing!"

"Did it work?" Li Tutu bared his teeth, revealing an expectant smile.

Du Tan was one of the few friends he could talk to at school. Today, when he saw that Du Tan was having a bit of trouble, he thought of Xu Ran's Starfire Foster Care Shop and suggested that Du Tan give it a try.

Du Tan also truly trusted him and went without a second thought.

And now, it seemed the effect was pretty good?

"More than just effective!" Du Tan exclaimed in a low voice, "It's wonderful, can you believe my Healing Mushroom spent fifty minutes training its healing skill during that one hour of training time?"

"Huh?" Li Tutu's eyes widened.

He was well aware of the situation with Du Tan's Healing Mushroom.

Before, it was quite difficult to get the Healing Mushroom to use its healing skill, and now it was actually willing to train the healing skill actively?

"So your problem is solved, right?" Li Tutu looked at Du Tan.

"Yes," Du Tan said with a smile on his face, "Next class, the Demon King Qi won't criticize me anymore."

The Demon King Qi was Qi Yue, the Pet Beast Skill Training teacher of Du Tan's class.

Qi Yue had criticized Du Tan more than once for his Healing Mushroom's complete lack of training in healing skills.

In Qi Yue's words, although Du Tan's Healing Mushroom had a peculiar personality, indulging it was the root cause of its continued avoidance of training in healing skills.

Later, there would be another class with Qi Yue, and judging by the Healing Mushroom's previous behavior, Du Tan guessed he was in for another reprimand.

But...

At this moment, Du Tan was for the first time looking forward to Demon King Qi's class starting sooner.
