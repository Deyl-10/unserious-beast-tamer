Chapter 464: Chapter 274 Nightmare, Thrilling Part 2

Ziyun shook its head reluctantly and spoke out.@@novelbin@@

Even if it truly encountered danger, it would not do this!

After all, it would be the only one to return, effectively abandoning Xu Ran and the other two little ones.

No matter what kind of opponent it faced, it would never do such a thing!

“I’m just worried about unexpected situations,” Xu Ran said with a wry smile when he saw Ziyun’s resistant expression, feeling a warmth in his heart, “If that’s the case, then we won’t leave any behind.”

“We’ll just be careful, and it shouldn’t be a problem.”

“Meow~” (I’ll lead the way!)

A vibrant fighting spirit ignited in Ziyun’s eyes as it volunteered first.

Although everyone had set out together, because Cancan’s body was so large, the actual entry into the protective range would definitely be staggered.

That place in the Thunderous Land was most likely related to the Thunder Attribute, and it was also the strongest attacker in the team, so there was no shirking this responsibility now.

Soon, it planned to stand on top of Cancan’s head.

In doing so, it would be the first to enter the range!

Nightmare?

There was not a trace of fear in Ziyun’s eyes.

A mere nightmare would not defeat it!

“Xi Lu~” (I’ll support everyone!)

Star let out a neigh.

Though Cancan’s body was large, Star’s Star Refusal Ring was sufficient to cover it and also envelop Ziyun and Xu Ran, who were standing on top of Cancan.

As the support corner of the team, it would do everything in its power!

Support to the max!

“Qia!” (Then let’s set off!)

Cancan shouted excitedly.

Being naturally curious about everything, it felt as though its explorer’s soul was now ablaze with passion!

With a step forward, Cancan’s miniature frame swelled against the wind, quickly restoring to a span of over three hundred meters, its massive form like a small mountain, exuding an overwhelming presence even in the night.

Its head, as majestic as a true dragon’s, seemed to lower from the clouds until it reached the ground.

“Meow~” (Charge~)

Full of excitement, Ziyun shouted, its figure flashing as it jumped onto Cancan’s head, clinging to the single horn on its forehead, its heterochromatic eyes burning as they looked toward the unseen depths below.

“Ziyun, be careful,” Xu Ran cautioned before joining Star and ascending onto the thick, solid scales in the center of Cancan.

From this position, Star’s Star Refusal Ring could cover Cancan’s entire body better, and Xu Ran stood with Star because the two were going to be linked by the Fated Star Pulling contract.

Accompanied by a born starlight shuttling from the void, the vital energies of Xu Ran and Star merged rapidly from two into one, and under the special enhancement of Fated Star Pulling, they climbed steadily, like a deep and conspicuous glimmer in the night.

The next moment, intricate, dark patterns emerged around Ziyun and Cancan, swirling around them, and an instantaneously firm resistance, solid and indestructible as a boulder, descended, while the momentum of Cancan and Ziyun soared at this moment!

Three Star Skill, Full Moon Level·Night Rune!

“Qia~” (Good!)

Feeling its power growing stronger, Cancan’s eyes were filled with excitement.

Due to the special circumstances, it was not convenient for it to use Echoing of Earth Vein and Jiezimixu to enhance itself right now, otherwise the large movements would instantly alert the guardian below.

Therefore, the only enhancement power it could rely on was Star’s Night Rune.

Fortunately, the main character of this action was not it, but rather Ziyun, which was now holding onto the single horn on top of its head, its eyes filled with sharp thunderous light.

Under the enhancement of the Night Rune, Ziyun’s presence had already climbed to its peak, its limbs and body nearly turned into lightning at the same time, with sharp electric light constantly piercing the air, emitting sharp thunderous roars.

Even a hint of obscure black appeared in the depths of its eyes.

That was the power of Divine Punishment, ready to be unleashed at any moment.

Although Ziyun still vividly remembered the consequences that the last Divine Punishment brought, if it really came down to a critical moment, it would use it if it had to!

After all, this was its strongest skill at the moment.

Also because of this subtle gathering of power, Ziyun was surrounded by an extremely dangerous presence, like a sharp long knife, not to be faced directly!

“Let’s go!”

With everything ready, Xu Ran gave the command in a low voice.

“Xi Lu~”

With a scream from Star, bright starlight blossomed from the tip of its single horn, scattering in all directions, ultimately covering Cancan’s whole body, enveloping Xu Ran and the three pets within.

What followed was a sensation of tranquility and peace.

Though this starlight seemed to have no effect at the moment, its very existence was a strong protective force, a reassuring presence!

Three Star Skill, Full Moon Level·Star Refusal Ring!

The next moment, Cancan’s massive body began to submerge like sinking into a mud pond, descending slowly and steadily as the hard soil and rock around it seemed to soften, creating slight ripples around its body.

Soon, Cancan’s body had completely disappeared underground.

The surface returned to its original state, as if nothing had happened.

Below ground, the exploration of one person and three pets officially began.

Under Cancan’s precise control, they continued to descend at a slow pace.

After a while, Cancan’s voice echoed in the minds of Xu Ran and the other two little ones.

“Qia~” (We have sunk two kilometers.)

“Continue,” Xu Ran responded with Contractual Sensing, his expression growing more serious.
