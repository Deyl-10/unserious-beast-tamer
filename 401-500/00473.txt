Chapter 473: Chapter 276: The Special Thunder Dragon Stone, The Thing within the Stone!_3

But after growing to a certain extent, the Thunder Dragon Stone would no longer continue to grow larger.

Its maximum length was about two meters forty to two meters fifty.

Once the Thunder Dragon Stone reached this length, it would begin to shrink the purple crystal part.

Yet, the golden dragon-shaped lightning would continue to grow.

This was a process of energy condensation.

Through such a process, the Thunder Dragon Stone would become even purer.

Until eventually, the purple crystal part of the Thunder Dragon Stone disappeared completely.

At that moment, the golden dragon-shaped lightning would also dissipate rapidly into the void, having lost its shell’s protection.

This was the entire process of the Thunder Dragon Stone from birth to disappearance.

It was for this reason that the Guardians would regularly patrol the cave, removing Thunder Dragon Stones that had shrunk to the brink of dissipation and sealing them within the rock walls.

Without contact with the Thunder God Silent Dragon, the Thunder Dragon Stones would not continue to grow, thus preserving their optimal state.

What the Guardian gifted to one person with three pets was exactly such a Thunder Dragon Stone that had grown to its peak.

And so, the one with three pets understood why the one Cancan had found was less energetic than the one Ziyun had discovered.

The one Cancan found was precisely a Thunder Dragon Stone at its maximum length.

Whereas, the one Ziyun found was a Thunder Dragon Stone in its shrinking stage.

Consequently, the one Ziyun found was naturally superior.

“Senior, are you really giving us such a precious Thunder Dragon Stone?” Knowing the value of the small Thunder Dragon Stone in his hand, even Xu Ran, with his thick skin, felt a bit embarrassed.

After all, they had already chosen one with the other party’s permission.

“Lulu~”

(Take it~)

The Guardian with dark purple eyes nodded with a hint of a smile.

“Then thank you very much, Senior.” Xu Ran showed a grateful expression.

He would naturally not accept such a kindness without giving something in return.@@novelbin@@

After thinking it through, Xu Ran quickly had an idea.

“Senior, you’ve been staying in this cave for a long time, can you go out?”

“Lulu~”

(I do go out to take a look regularly, but not for too long.)

The Guardian nodded and spoke.

“In that case,” Xu Ran smiled, “next time, you can come to my Foster Shop, and I can perform Washing and Protection for you, Senior.”

“Sleep Demon knows the location of my shop.”

“Looby Looby~”

The Sleep Demon crawled out from the thick fur of the Guardian, nodding expectantly.

The human’s Washing and Protection was super comfortable!

“Lulu~”

(This…)

The Guardian’s face revealed a thoughtful expression.

In the past, the Sleep Demon would bring Mystical Wood Dew, produced by the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood, to cleanse its body.

But now, it had been a long time since there was any production of Mystical Wood Dew.

Although it lived in a dark cave and did not care much about its appearance,

the occasional discomfort in its body still somewhat bothered it.

Washing and Protection shouldn’t take too long, so maybe… it should give it a try?

After all, the effects after the Sleep Demon’s Washing and Protection seemed quite good indeed.

Glancing at the Sleep Demon, the Guardian nodded slightly amidst the silence.

“Senior, you are welcome anytime.” Seeing the other party’s agreement, Xu Ran nodded with a smile, “Then, I shall take my leave for today.”

“Lulu~”

(Okay.)

Watching as Cancan led Xu Ran and the other two pets through the rock wall of the cave, heading back toward the ground and disappearing into the cave, the Guardian gradually withdrew its gaze.

After standing in place for a while, it moved its heavy steps towards the cave where the Thunder God Silent Dragon had fallen.

Soon, the cave appeared before its eyes.

Inserting several Thunder Dragon Stones that one person with three pets had chosen but not taken back into the ground, allowing them to absorb power and grow better, the Guardian then seemed to remember something and walked to a certain spot within the cave.

There, was where Star had found that special Thunder Dragon Stone.

After observing the spot for a moment, the Guardian’s eyes still carried a hint of doubt.

It had never seen such a flawed Thunder Dragon Stone before.

Why did such a Thunder Dragon Stone appear?

While pondering, the Guardian inadvertently glanced towards the direction of the Thunder God Silent Dragon and then trembled slightly.

The Thunder God Silent Dragon, lying quietly in the cave, maintained a pose with its neck slightly stretched as if, before its downfall, it strived to see something.

And the Guardian’s current position was right in front of its large and majestic head.

—————–

“I’m finally home.”

Not until they reached the Starfire Foster Care Shop did the trio breathe a sigh of relief.

It’s said that an innocent man is free of guilt, but he who carries a jade is guilty.

Even in the peaceful Monster Wooden Domain, carrying resources of Overlord stage quality back home brought them no small amount of stress.

Now back in the shop, that weight was completely lifted off their minds.

“I’ll keep this Thunder Dragon Stone secure first.” Xu Ran took out a wooden box, carefully placed the small Thunder Dragon Stone gifted by the Guardian inside, then turned his attention to the other murky and dim Thunder Dragon Stone, “Next, let’s have a look at this one.”

“Meow~” (No problem!)

Ziyun nodded emphatically.

The details of that small Thunder Dragon Stone were now very clear.

Such a precious resource, it must be used at the most suitable time later in order to ensure no waste.

But the other Thunder Dragon Stone they had selected remained a mystery.

Ziyun, who had gambled once, couldn’t wait to learn the secret.

What exactly was hidden inside it?

“Should we crack it open directly?” Placing the approximately one-meter-long Thunder Dragon Stone on the table, Xu Ran’s face showed a degree of caution.
