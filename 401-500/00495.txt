Chapter 495: Chapter 282: The Training Partner is on Fire too?

“Thank you for choosing Starfire Foster.”

Facing the excited customer Zhang Tu, Xu Ran’s expression remained calm.

After all, this was a matter of course.

The ingredients provided by the system were priced according to market value when calculating costs; they were essentially equivalent to the foster care fees. However, the system had a mysterious source of ingredients, so the actual cost deducted was only thirty percent.

As long as one saw the superior foster environment at Starfire Foster Shop and understood the luxurious meal standards, no one could refuse to send their Pet Beast here.

Now that the Beast Master Association had opened up the situation with a certificate, it was up to his own capability to take it from there.

Looking at the excited Zhang Tu, Xu Ran smiled and reminded him.

“Sir, would you like Washing and Protection as well?”

“Oh, right!”

Zhang Tu slapped his forehead, only then remembering that his initial reason for coming to Starfire Foster Shop had been to get his family’s Pet Beast a session of Washing and Protection.

The Hexagram Star Array flickered behind him, and soon, four figures emerged from the energy-converging storm.

“I’ll leave them in your care, Boss Xu.”

“No problem.” After glancing at the four Pet Beasts, Xu Ran’s smile grew a bit wider.@@novelbin@@

This was a big deal indeed.

“Let’s go downstairs.”

—————–

Busy yet fulfilling management time flew by in the blink of an eye.

Zhang Tu, the customer interested in Starfire Foster’s Foster Care Service, was just the beginning.

After Zhang Tu, the shop’s previously desolate foster services suddenly became popular. In just one afternoon, Xu Ran led seven or eight customers through a tour of the shop’s foster environment.

And without exception, these visiting customers decided to bring their Pet Beasts for fostering, though some had to wait a while because their current foster arrangements at other shops had not yet ended.

The number of Starfire Foster Care Residents broke into double digits in just one afternoon.

“Boss Xu, I’ll leave my plump coo sculpture in your hands; you must take good care of it,” a customer transferring his Pet Beast reluctantly stood at the store entrance, once again urging Xu Ran.

Just now, after seeing the foster environment at Starfire Foster, he had resolutely decided to pick up his Pet Beast early from the previous foster shop and bring it here.

In his words, after seeing the environment at Starfire Foster, he couldn’t bear to let his Pet Beast suffer at the previous shop any longer.

Hmm… I wonder how the unfortunate colleague is dealing with that mental shadow.

“Don’t worry,” Xu Ran said with a warm smile on his face.

As a fellow Beast Master, he understood the care hidden behind the customer’s rambling words.

“I’ve taken note of all the special instructions you mentioned just now. From now on, I’ll do my utmost to give your Pet Beast the best life possible.”

“Hehe~ I trust you, Boss Xu.” The customer scratched his head, grinning, “Previously, when I had Washing and Protection at your shop, I already felt you were very reliable.”

“I have to be reliable,” Xu Ran said calmly, nodding.

“But Boss Xu, there’s something I’m really curious about,” the customer’s tone shifted as he suddenly asked, “Your shop’s Washing and Protection Service and Foster Care Service are both so amazing, what about your Accompanying Training Service?”

Upon hearing this, the other customers waiting outside and those inside the shop turned their gaze towards him.

Clearly, many customers harbored similar curiosities.

If Starfire Foster had only one outstanding Washing and Protection Service, then perhaps people wouldn’t make such inferences.

But with both an excellent Washing and Protection Service and such an exceptional Foster Care Service, wouldn’t the remaining Accompanying Training Service also be exceptional?

“That question…” Xu Ran’s face took on an added hint of amusement.

The customers’ curiosity was within his expectations.

One could say, with the Foster Care Service breaking new ground, the Accompanying Training Service would soon follow.

“All I can say is that every service offered by our shop is worth its price. For the specifics of the Accompanying Training Service, you can experience it for yourself.”

At Xu Ran’s response, people couldn’t help but roll their eyes.

It seemed like Boss Xu had said something, yet not said anything at the same time.

Just then, several somewhat naive voices came from one side of the crowd.

“Du Tan, is this the shop you mentioned?”

“There’s such a long line; can we get a turn?”

“Uh, let me ask.”

After a few brief exchanges, Du Tan stood on tiptoe from within the crowd, looking in Xu Ran’s direction, “Boss Xu, do we have to queue for training as well?”

“There’s no need to queue for fostering or training,” Xu Ran said with a smile, “Only Washing and Protection requires queuing.”

“That’s good,” Du Tan visibly relaxed, then quickly led his friends over to Xu Ran, “Boss Xu, my classmates and I would like to have Accompanying Training here!”

In an instant, everyone’s gaze turned to Du Tan and the young men and women behind him.

Finding himself under so many stares, Du Tan’s face took on a bewildered look, “Boss Xu, what’s happening?”

Before Xu Ran could speak, the Beast Master who had fostered the plump coo sculpture couldn’t contain his curiosity and asked, “Have you tried the Accompanying Training Service at Boss Xu’s shop?”

“Yes, that’s right,” Du Tan nodded, “I brought my Healing Mushroom here at noon. Boss Xu’s Accompanying Training Service resolved a very troubling issue for me.”
