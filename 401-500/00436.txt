Chapter 436: Chapter 266: Make a Big Score!_2

Three Luminous Soil Stones?

The members of the Earthy Rat Clan’s eyes lit up in unison.

For these Earth Extraordinary Creatures, gathering resources like Luminous Soil Stones wasn’t difficult, nor were they precious resources.

Three Luminous Soil Stones just to have one clan member go for Washing and Protection?

The quicker-reacting Earth Rock Rats had already begun to count on their claws, calculating how many Luminous Soil Stones their whole clan would need for Washing and Protection.

Before they could figure it out, the Ground Raccoon Clan Leader shot a disdainful glance at the Ground Raccoon that had interjected, and then slightly shook his head.

“Grr~”

Don’t listen to its nonsense! The price for Washing and Protection isn’t three Luminous Soil Stones.

Eh?

The Earth Rock Rats, who had just been excited, felt like a bucket of cold water had been dumped on them after hearing the Ground Raccoon Clan Leader’s words, immediately calming down.

Indeed… how could Washing and Protection, comparable to the precious resource Mystical Wood Dew, be equivalent to Luminous Soil Stones which they hardly used for cultivation?

That Ground Raccoon must have been joking, the real price must be more expensive…

Without waiting for the Earth Rock Rats to ask, the Ground Raccoon Clan Leader already shook his head slightly, speaking up again.

“Grr~ Grr~”

Washing and Protection is based on body size, we are Medium Size, but you can only be considered Small Size, so your Washing and Protection price is resources equivalent to seven Beast Master Points~

Eh?

The Earth Rock Rat clan members were stunned once more upon hearing this.

Due to their frequent interactions with humans, they were quite familiar with Beast Master Points, and often used this special equivalent when trading resources with humans.

Three Luminous Soil Stones, when converted into Beast Master Points, amounted to twenty-seven points.

Yet they only needed seven Beast Master Points to get one clan member washed and protected?!

That means…

With one Luminous Soil Stone, they could even have leftovers?!

With this realization, the eyes of the Earth Rock Rat clan members shone brightly, their faces filled with delighted expressions.

Isn’t this price way too cheap?!

“Squeak~” @@novelbin@@

No time to lose, I’m off!

With no more desire to stay on the Ground Raccoon’s territory, the mighty member of the Earth Rock Rat Clan greeted the Ground Raccoon Clan Leader and departed with its clan members.

Watching their silhouettes recede, the Ground Raccoon Clan Leader’s eyes were filled with mirth, yet he didn’t forget to throw out a reminder.

“Grr~”

That shop has closed for the day, you can only go tomorrow morning!

“Make a big score?”

Hearing Liu Fengyun’s words, Xu Ran’s face carried a hint of surprise.

This Boss Liu, who seemed refined and scholarly, had a bandit-like edge to his speech.

“What do you mean exactly by making a big score, Boss Liu?” Xu Ran asked with interest.

Deep down, he wasn’t someone who settled for the status quo either.

If what the other party mentioned suited his taste, he wouldn’t mind joining in.

“That…” Liu Fengyun smiled, paused for just a moment without giving a direct answer, but posed a question instead.

“I saw Boss Xu providing Washing and Protection Service today with the accompaniment of beast taming customers, which means there’s nothing in the process that couldn’t be seen by others, is there?”

“Yes.” Xu Ran nodded slightly.

The techniques he had learned from the system were not simply something one could learn by watching; as for the formulae for those wash fluids, even the slightest deviation could lead to drastic errors, and merely watching wouldn’t enable learning anything.

Therefore, he could confidently let others watch the entire Washing and Protection process.

“Our Wind and Cloud Foster Care Shop operates the same way.” Liu Fengyun’s face showed a pleased smile of finding a kindred spirit, “I believe that the real value of excellent Washing and Protection lies in the experience, not in something that can be stolen with a glance.”

“It’s not just you and me – most of the ones invited to Monster Wooden City to run Foster Shops from out of town feel the same,” Liu Fengyun paused again, “Compared to them, the local Foster Shops around here are… heh heh.”

He shook his head lightly, chuckling, “I still remember, after our Wind and Cloud Foster Care Shop gradually started doing better, these local peers never ceased to spy on our shop.”

“And after launching their Washing and Protection Services, they did not welcome customers to join, keeping everyone who wanted a look out,” Liu Fengyun shook his head slightly, “Such overprotectiveness, really petty-minded.”

“Is that so…” Xu Ran’s expression also became somewhat peculiar, “I thought Universe Foster Store was an exception.”

“Let’s not talk about that.” Liu Fengyun smiled, “Boss Xu asked me earlier how we were planning to make a big score.”

“None of us, the Foster Shops from out of town, want anything more than to gain a firm foothold locally, to have a good number of clients.”

“Therefore, we naturally need to make more people aware of our shops and show them exactly what our Washing and Protection Services are like.” Liu Fengyun’s eyes carried a hint of anticipation, “I was thinking… to bring everyone together for a public Washing and Protection showcase!”

“Good!” Xu Ran’s eyes sparkled as he swiftly nodded.

Liu Fengyun had hit the nail on the head with one of his remarks – they needed to let more people know about their shops.

This perfectly aligned with the system’s task to increase fame.

And holding a public showcase of Washing and Protection, just thinking about it was enough to outline the concept.

To display the entire process of Washing and Protection to everyone, to let them see the contrast of Extraordinary Creatures before and after clearly.

There simply wasn’t a more direct and appealing method than this.

“Boss Liu, do you have more concrete ideas? When and where will it be held?” Xu Ran asked eagerly, his face filled with anticipation, “Our Starfire Foster Care Shop is in!”
