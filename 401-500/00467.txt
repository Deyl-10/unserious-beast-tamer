Chapter 467: Chapter 275: Dragon’s Skeletal Remains, Thunder Dragon Stone

“`

Accompanied by the steadfast neigh of Star, the illusory scene shattered in an instant.

In the silence, Star gazed at the caring figure of its father, Chasing Wind, as he dissolved into nothingness, leaving the resolution in its eyes undiminished.

In the next moment, Xu Ran and the other two little ones materialized not far ahead.

Has this nightmare ended?

Excitement surfaced in Star’s eyes.

“Xi Lu~” (I’m coming~)

With a neigh, it raised its hooves and dashed toward its companions.

However, at the next moment, a look of astonishment appeared in Star’s eyes.

With every step it took forward, its companions moved farther ahead, widening the gap between them until they were merely specks in the distance, just as Star once could not catch up with the other Little Horses in its memory.

“Xi Lu?!”

—————–

“Ran! Time to eat!”

Hearing this familiar voice, Xu Ran rubbed his eyes and sat up from the bed.

He glanced at the familiar furnishings, his gaze sharpening as his expression suddenly changed.

Is this… my home from my previous life?@@novelbin@@

How is that possible?

Hadn’t I already transmigrated?

He vividly remembered that just moments ago, he and his three Pet Beasts were fighting side by side and had been attacked by a mysterious King Stage Guardian, causing him to lose consciousness.

Could it be that I died again in that battle and transmigrated back here?

Or is this a nightmare spun by that Guardian?

That’s right! The system!

Xu Ran’s eyes brightened, and he summoned The system with a thought.

Seeing the familiar system panel and the Pet Beasts still listed there, Xu Ran heaved a sigh of relief.

It seems I haven’t transmigrated back.

This is merely a nightmare constructed by the other party.

But truth be told…

Xu Ran curiously surveyed his surroundings, amazed.

That this nightmare would be in the world of his former life was beyond his expectations.

“Knock, knock, knock.”

Accompanied by several brisk knocks, the door opened at that moment, and a middle-aged woman wearing an apron stepped in, frowning slightly at the sight of Xu Ran.

“Ran, why didn’t you respond when I called you!”

“I’m coming, I’m coming!” Xu Ran chuckled, quickly got out of bed, approached the woman, paused, and then hugged her tightly, “Mom, I’ve missed you.”

“This child… what’s gotten into you?” The woman’s face held a touch of confusion.

“It’s nothing.” Xu Ran laughed and let go of his mother, “Where’s dad?”

“He’s in the living room. If you don’t get up, he’s going to whack you again,” the woman replied, slightly irked.

“That’s okay, I kind of miss getting smacked by dad,” Xu Ran continued to laugh carelessly, “By the way, what’s for breakfast, Yangchun noodles?”

“Yes, and I added two fried eggs for you,” the woman nodded.

“That’s fantastic, it’s been months since I had a bite of that,” Xu Ran laughed heartily, rushing to the dining table. Seeing the familiar steaming thin noodles topped with two perfectly fried eggs, his eyes couldn’t help but redden slightly.

If this is a nightmare, then let it last a little longer.

He remembered this day.

This was the last day in this world, where after eating his mother’s breakfast, he, unemployed after graduation, set out for a job interview, only to be involved in a car accident on his way there; when he woke up, he was in another world.

“Sleeping late again,” grunted the middle-aged man in the living room as Xu Ran sat down. Putting the newspaper on the coffee table, he came to sit at the dining table. “Is getting up early really that difficult for you?”

“Dad, how many young people can manage to wake up early these days?” Xu Ran swallowed a mouthful of Yangchun noodles and responded with a smile.

Inside, a familiar feeling surfaced.

It seemed that the conversation back then was the same.

“Hmph, once you’re done eating, clean yourself up. Look at that bird’s nest of hair; what company would hire someone who can’t be bothered to groom himself?” The middle-aged man shook his head slightly and stopped speaking, quietly eating his noodles.

“Don’t worry.” Looking at his stern yet loving father, Xu Ran gave a silent laugh, then turned to his mother, who was still busy tidying up the kitchen. “Mom, stop tidying up and eat.”

“Okay.” The mother came out with two small dishes, “Let’s eat.”

With each bite of the Yangchun noodles, Xu Ran’s eyes were brimming with nostalgia.

What was once an ordinary dish now seemed like the rarest of delicacies, each bite savored with care.

After finishing the bowl of noodles, leaving no soup behind, Xu Ran reluctantly handed over his bowl and chopsticks. “Mom, I’m done.”

“Why did you eat so cleanly today?” His mother looked surprised, then laughed it off, “As long as you’re full, go and give it your all, hopefully landing that new job today!”

“Get the job…” Xu Ran glanced at the clock on the wall.

In his former life at this moment, he would have already left the house.

What came next was the car accident and the transmigration.

Because of the leisurely pace he took in eating his noodles just now, he was still at home.

So…

This nightmare should also be coming to an end, right?

As the surroundings began to blur into unreality, Xu Ran let out a silent sigh, then flashed the brightest of smiles at his parents.

“Mom, Dad, don’t worry, I’m doing really well now.”

As his words fell, the scene around him, along with his mother standing there with the bowl and chopsticks and his father sitting at the table with the newspaper, all dissolved into nothingness.
