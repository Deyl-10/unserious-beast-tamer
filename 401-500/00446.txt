Chapter 446: Chapter 269: High Difficulty? No Difficulty!_2

“Today, I finally get to see your skills in action.”

“A complete transformation would be an exaggeration.” Xu Ran smiled modestly, “According to the schedule, Ms. Du should be able to wash and groom one more pet beast before it’s my turn to take the stage and embarrass myself.”

“Boss Xu is too modest!”

“Hahaha, Boss Xu is the youngest here, truly a case of a young hero!”

Hearing Xu Ran’s words, the other shop owners laughed amiably.

In the midst of everyone’s conversations and laughter, Ms. Du Huayan on the stage also welcomed her final customer.

It was a man with a slightly sullen complexion, by his side was a large bell floating in the air, shimmering with a faint green light. The surface of the bell was also covered in green patterns that resembled flowing water.

A Wind attribute Leader Stage Transcendent Being, the Wind Bell.

“We thank this gentleman for coming on stage, and now Ms. Du Huayan, the owner of the Hundred Flowers Foster Store, will begin the grooming for your Pet Beast!”

The host spoke briefly and then walked off the stage, leaving it to Ms. Du Huayan.

Ms. Du Huayan slightly furrowed her brows, gazing at the hovering Wind Bell. After a moment, her brows relaxed, revealing a smile, “Please follow me.”

Outside the stage, the normally chatty foster shop owners became more serious as they watched the events on stage.

“Wind Bell… Certainly, grooming a half-elemental form Transcendent Being is not simple,” Zhang Qinglan said, watching his fellow villager begin preparations with a slight frown.

“As far as I know, the Hundred Flowers Foster Store previously did not accept elemental Pet Beasts for grooming because their grooming methods would not be effective with elemental creatures.”

“This is a public grooming; there is no way to refuse the customer, but if the grooming does not go well, it could negatively affect the Hundred Flowers Foster Store.”

“That would be rather bad.” Xu Ran couldn’t help but frown along, “I’m not sure if Ms. Du has mastered any other grooming methods.”

“I think, Boss Du must be confident,” Liu Fengyun spoke up softly, “After all, she seems quite composed right now.”

“However…”

Liu Fengyun’s voice slightly paused, and a grave expression surfaced in his eyes.

“It seems that, among the audience, I’ve spotted a few individuals who shouldn’t be here.”

“People who shouldn’t be here?” Qi Cang raised his eyebrows and couldn’t help but stand up to look around. His gaze quickly locked onto a certain area, and his expression turned ugly, “It’s those guys!”

The others followed Qi Cang’s gaze and soon also saw the group in question.

Leading them was Liu Yu, along with local foster shop owners who had joined forces to suppress them.

The rival shop owners seemed to notice their looks and looked back challengingly and with ill intent.

“Boss!”

An employee dispatched from the Wind and Cloud Foster Care Shop to assist hurried over, walked up to Liu Fengyun, and whispered a few words before taking his leave.

Once the employee had left, Liu Fengyun’s expression turned sour.

“It’s confirmed,” he looked at the Wind Bell and its Beast Master on the stage, “The Beast Master of that Wind Bell came here with the local foster shop owners.”

Instantly, everyone’s expression changed.

The meaning behind this was self-evident.

The Wind Bell’s Beast Master was in cahoots with the local foster shops.

Choosing a pet beast that Ms. Du was not familiar with grooming was an intentional act by the rivals!

“Thankfully, Boss Du is prepared.” Zhang Qinglan, previously worried about his fellow villager, now looked at Ms. Du Huayan’s actions and relaxed slightly.

Because Ms. Du Huayan was now using a different grooming method than before.

She was not using the bath liquids made from grassy and woody type Transcendent Resources. Instead, she used a handful of mixed, finely ground, lightweight sandy grains.

This was the most common grooming method used for Wind attribute elemental Transcendent Beings.@@novelbin@@

All the necessary grooming resources and materials were ground into grooming sand, then the Wind attribute elemental Transcendent Being would absorb them. The grooming sand, carried by the wind, would then deeply cleanse both the inside and outside of its body before being expelled.

“With such a method, the Wind Bell can be groomed thoroughly, at least eighty percent,” another foster shop owner commented, “As a semi-elemental type Transcendent Being, the Wind Bell’s grooming still requires some additional things.”

“Ms. Du must be aware of this,” Xu Ran pointed to an item Ms. Du Huayan had prepared on the grooming table, “That is the grooming paste Ms. Du has just mixed, intended for cleaning and maintaining the actual physical parts of the Wind Bell.”

The group engaged in a flurry of discussions about the Wind Bell’s grooming.

Meanwhile, on stage, Ms. Du Huayan completed the grooming of the Wind Bell with poise, without any mishaps.

In just over ten minutes, the green light around the Wind Bell deepened, and an invisible energy wind swirled around it. Its body gleamed with a lustrous sheen, looking as if it was thoroughly refreshed.

It swayed in the air, ringing out a cheerful ‘lingling’ to express its gratitude to Ms. Du Huayan.

And the sullen-faced Beast Master had a somewhat relieved expression at this moment.

Although he had come with the local foster shops and was likely aware of their intentions, he was a customer, not a lackey of those shops.

So when the Wind Bell was well groomed, he wouldn’t deliberately trouble the owner who did the grooming.

And moreover…

He was beginning to consider whether to entrust the grooming of the Wind Bell and his other two Pet Beasts to this place called the Hundred Flowers Foster Store in the future.
