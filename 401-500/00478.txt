Chapter 478: Chapter 277: Beyond the Darkness, a New Village Blooms_4

After satisfying their curiosity about the Thunderous Land, Cancan, the most restless of the three little ones, also seemed to have quieted down for the time being.

“Welcome to the light…”

Upon hearing the noise from outside the door, Xu Ran, who had just seen off a customer and had only had time to stretch, turned his head to look outside. His voice paused, and a smile spread across his face, “Senior, you’re here.”

Standing at the door were two furry bundles, one large and one small.

The larger one was ten meters tall, and its massive body barely fit into the expanded store, while the smaller one was about one meter in height.

Together, the small one looked like a tuft of fur that had fallen from the large one.

It was the Sleep Demon and its father, the Guardian of the Thunderous Land.

The large and the small had come at Xu Ran’s invitation to experience washing and protection.

“Lulu~”

(I’ve arrived.)

The Guardian nodded, looking at Xu Ran with a hint of strangeness in his gaze.

After entering the cave where the Thunder God Silent Dragon had perished yesterday, it felt vaguely that the Thunder Dragon Stone that Xu Ran and the three little ones had taken away wasn’t as simple as it had thought.

But, having spoken, it could only give it away.

“You’re very welcome.” Xu Ran nodded with a smile, promptly running a System Identification.

[Race Name: Dream Pursuer

Attribute: Super ability

Growth Stage: Monarch Stage

Body Type: Super Large Size

Washing and Protection requirement: ★★★★☆

Evaluation: This is a big tuft of fur with dreams in its heart, but cleanliness is equally important for its body.]

Dream Pursuer…

Is this the actual race name of the Guardian?

Xu Ran glanced at the large tuft of fur before him, his smile growing even richer.

“Senior, please follow me.” Having said this, Xu Ran signaled the three little ones to mind the store and then walked towards the washing and protection room behind him.

The Sleep Demon stayed in the store, looking around with curiosity, and then its light purple eyes turned to the three little ones who were also staring at it.

“Looby?”

In the washing room, Xu Ran quickly finished a series of preparations for the washing and protection.

Gazing at the Dream Pursuer lying down quietly but still appearing extremely large, he took a deep breath and began to carefully section off its long and dense fur.

After dividing the Dream Pursuer’s fur into dozens of different areas, Xu Ran picked up the shower head and carefully sprayed it over one area to moisten the fur.

The warm water flowed down through the fissures of the Dream Pursuer’s fur, passing over the skin hidden beneath the fur.

A strange sense of tickling pleasure caused the Dream Pursuer, already looking forward to this, to twist its body slightly.

“Lulu~”

(Your washing and protection is very comfortable.)

The deep voice of the Dream Pursuer echoed in the washing room.

“I’m glad you like it, Senior.” Xu Ran smiled, quickly soaking the fur in the section before him, then applied shampoo and began to meticulously scrub it with his palms.

With Xu Ran’s just-right rubbing force, the slight tickling was amplified, making the contentment in the Dream Pursuer’s eyes grow deeper.

Then, its purple-black eyes slowly closed, and it fell into a comfortable sleep, softly snoring as the sound echoed in the washing room.

Xu Ran paused his movements slightly, his face showing a hint of amusement.

The Dream Pursuer truly lived up to being an evolved form of the Sleep Demon.

Both of them had a really…

Remarkably synchronized and unique reaction to being washed.

Letting out a soft sigh, Xu Ran raised his head to look at the Dream Pursuer’s huge body.

If nothing unexpected happened, the being should be able to sleep for several hours now.

—————–

“Lulu~”

Feeling the comfortable sensation around its body fade gradually, the Dream Pursuer slowly woke from its deep sleep. It sat up slowly, a look of surprise emerging in its eyes.

It, which formerly felt discomfort sporadically throughout its body, now felt unprecedented comfort, and even using its power seemed more natural than before.

Glancing at the huge mirror on the side of the Washing and Protection room, the Dream Chaser’s eyes filled with even greater astonishment.

Is this… myself?

The larger one was ten meters tall, and its massive body barely fit into the expanded store, while the smaller one was only about a meter tall.

This large and small pair standing together made the smaller one seem like a mere tuft of fur that had fallen off the larger one.

They were none other than the Sleep Demon and its father, the Guardian of the Thunderous Land.

The large and small had come at Xu Ran’s invitation to experience Washing and Protection.

“Lulu~”

(I have arrived.)@@novelbin@@

The Guardian nodded and looked at Xu Ran with a glance that held a hint of strangeness.

After entering the Cave where the Thunder God Silent Dragon had fallen yesterday, it faintly felt that the Thunder Dragon Stone that Xu Ran and the three little ones had taken was not as simple as it had thought.

But since it had already been offered, it could only be given away.

“Welcome, welcome,” Xu Ran said with a smile, nodding and swiftly performing a System Identification.

[Race name: Dream Chaser

Attribute: Super ability

Growth Stage: Monarch Stage

Body type: Super Large Size

Washing and Protection requirement: ★★★★☆

Evaluation: This is a big fur ball with dreams in its heart, but cleanliness is equally important to its body.]

Dream Chasers…

Was that the race name of the Guardian?

Xu Ran took another look at the big fur ball in front of him, his smile growing thicker.

“Senior, please follow me,” Xu Ran said, then signaled the three little ones to look after the shop and headed towards the Washing and Protection room behind him.

The Sleep Demon stayed inside the store, curiously looking around, and then those light purple eyes turned to the three little ones who were watching it.

“Looby?”

Inside the Washing and Protection room, Xu Ran quickly finished a series of preparatory tasks for the washing.

Looking at the Dream Chaser, which was now lying down quietly but still appeared extremely large, he took a deep breath and started meticulously partitioning its long and fine fur.

After dividing the Dream Chaser’s fur into dozens of different areas, Xu Ran picked up the showerhead and carefully sprinkled it over one of the areas to wet the fur.

The warm water flowed down through the gaps in the Dream Chaser’s fur and passed over the skin hidden beneath it.

A strange tingling and pleasure, which had already been anticipated by the eager Dream Chaser, made it twist its body gently.

“Lulu~”

(Your Washing and Protection is very comfortable.)

The deep voice of the Dream Chaser echoed in the room.

“I’m glad you’re satisfied, Senior,” Xu Ran said with a smile, quickly soaking the fur in the area in front of him completely before applying the shampoo and carefully rubbing it in with his palms.

With Xu Ran’s just-right strength in kneading, that tingling sensation was amplified, causing the comfort in the Dream Chaser’s eyes to become even more intense.

Then, its dark purple eyes slowly closed, and it fell into a comfortable sleep, its breathing morphed into soft snores that reverberated in the Washing and Protection room.

The Washing and Protection efforts of Xu Ran stalled briefly, and his face took on a slightly peculiar color.

The Dream Chaser truly lived up to its evolution from the Sleep Demon.

Their reactions during Washing and Protection were…

Remarkably synchronized and unique.

With a slight sigh, Xu Ran lifted his head to look at the Dream Chaser’s massive body.

If nothing unexpected happened, it should be able to sleep for a few hours now.

—————–

“Lulu~”

As the comfortable sensation around its body gradually faded, the Dream Chaser slowly woke from its deep slumber. It sat up slowly, a look of surprise emerging in its eyes.

The body that used to feel uncomfortable here and there now felt unprecedented comfort, and even using its powers became more effortless than before.

Glancing at the huge mirror on the side of the Washing and Protection room again, the Dream Chaser’s eyes filled with even more astonishment.

Is this… myself?
