Chapter 471: Chapter 276: The Special Thunder Dragon Stone, The Thing within the Stone!

“This Thunder Dragon Stone…”

Upon receiving the Thunder Dragon Stone passed by Star, Xu Ran’s face took on a somewhat odd expression.

Compared to the surrounding stones that were particularly clear and dazzlingly beautiful, the one in front of him seemed lackluster, not only lacking in clarity that made the inside hard to discern but also missing the most distinct feature of the Thunder Dragon Stones, the golden, dragon-shaped thunderbolt hidden within.

So much so, that Xu Ran even doubted whether this stone was indeed a Thunder Dragon Stone, or perhaps it was one that had not yet fully formed.

“Star, do you think this Thunder Dragon Stone is any good?” Xu Ran looked at the Thunder Dragon Stone in his hand, then glanced at Star beside him, who was full of anticipation, and tentatively asked.

“Xi Lu~” (I don’t know, but I feel it’s very special.)

Star neighed in response, candidly speaking up.

Indeed, among all the Thunder Dragon Stones, this one was most unique.

“If that’s the case, then let’s keep it and let Ziyun choose later,” Xu Ran said with a smile as he set aside the Thunder Dragon Stone found by Star, and then looked towards Ziyun and Cancan.

They were still excitedly picking and comparing, searching for the best Thunder Dragon Stone.

Before long, the two little creatures each returned with their chosen Thunder Dragon Stones.

Cancan had chosen one that was two meters and forty centimeters long, the largest in the area it had searched.

Ziyun’s chosen Thunder Dragon Stone, however, was only one meter and fifty centimeters in length.

But compared to Cancan’s choice, the golden dragon-shaped thunder in this stone seemed much more robust.

Excitedly bringing back their respective finds, the two creatures’ gazes simultaneously turned to Star, who had returned early.

They were very curious about what kind of Thunder Dragon Stone Star had chosen.

“Star’s Thunder Dragon Stone is right here.” Seeing what the other two were thinking, Xu Ran pointed with a smile to the unique Thunder Dragon Stone that lay quietly on the ground.

Huh?

After glancing at the Thunder Dragon Stone on the ground, both creatures were taken aback.

Because it was so unique, they hadn’t even recognized it as a Thunder Dragon Stone when they first arrived.

Was this Star’s choice?

“Meow?” (Can this Thunder Dragon Stone really work?)

Ziyun’s eyes, filled with doubt, looked at the dull Thunder Dragon Stone at its feet.

As a Thunder Attribute Pet Beast, Ziyun could clearly feel that the golden, dragon-shaped thunder inside the Thunder Dragon Stones was the very essence of the entire resource.

After discovering this, it no longer chose solely based on the size of the Thunder Dragon Stones but rather the strength of the dragon-shaped thunder within.

And the Thunder Dragon Stone chosen by Star…

It didn’t even have the weakest dragon-shaped thunder, appearing like an empty shell. What good was such a Thunder Dragon Stone?

“Alright, you’ve all chosen what you think are the best Thunder Dragon Stones, now let’s have Ziyun make a choice among the three,” Xu Ran said with a smile, “The Thunder Dragon Stone is a Thunder Resource, definitely to be used by Ziyun.”

“Of course, Ziyun will also need to help its companions get other resources later.”

“Meow!” (No problem!)

Ziyun nodded vigorously, its eyes inevitably drifting towards the Thunder Dragon Stone it had chosen.

Among the three Thunder Dragon Stones, it naturally favored the one it had picked.

Seeming to understand Ziyun’s thoughts, Xu Ran coughed lightly, “Don’t rush, you can take a close look at all three Thunder Dragon Stones before you decide.”

“Meow~” (Okay~)

Ziyun’s gaze flashed, understanding Xu Ran’s intention.

It would be impolite not to even cast a look at the resources its companions had taken great effort to pick for it.

Then, it was better to look at them all.

Ziyun set aside the Thunder Dragon Stone it had chosen.

It had already thoroughly examined that one, there was no need to look at it again.

Ziyun first approached the Thunder Dragon Stone chosen by Cancan, lightly touched it with a paw, and tried to resonate with the Thunderforce contained in the stone using its own Thunder Attribute power.

This was a little trick Ziyun had discovered in its search earlier.

Using this method, it could easily test the strength of the Thunderforce within the Thunder Dragon Stone and judge the quality of it.@@novelbin@@

“Cha!” (How is it, how is it!)

Cancan’s eyes widened with anticipation as it looked at Ziyun.

The one it had chosen must surely be the best Thunder Dragon Stone in the entire cave.

Like its own body type, big!

How could such a large Thunder Dragon Stone not be good?

“Meow~” (It’s a bit less energetic than the one I chose.)

After the investigation, Ziyun shook its head regretfully.

It was as it had assessed visually, this Thunder Dragon Stone, though larger in size, did not have the strongest golden dragon-shaped thunder, and the energy was naturally weaker.

“Cha~” (Okay~)

Cancan nodded somewhat regretfully, but wasn’t disheartened and quickly shifted its gaze to the one Star had chosen.

“Cha!” (Let’s see Big Brother Star’s!)

Ziyun nodded and slowly stepped towards the Thunder Dragon Stone chosen by Star.

Looking at that lusterless, murky-feeling Thunder Dragon Stone, Ziyun was already thinking of how to gently critique this inferior stone afterward.

“Xi Lu~” (Give it a try.)

Star neighed softly, indicating Ziyun to give it a try.

The intelligent creature had already sensed that its companions were not optimistic about the stone it had chosen.
