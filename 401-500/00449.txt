Chapter 449: Chapter 270: The Reborn Exquisite Flower King!

“`

The moment the Fate Necklace linked the Exquisite Flower King with Cancan, the slender body of the Exquisite Flower King couldn’t help but tremble.

Before it, Cancan, who belonged to the same earth-based species, was clearly at the same growth stage, but the latter’s strength was so formidable that the power surging towards it felt especially abundant.

The body of the Exquisite Flower King also became slightly swollen due to the infusion of this power, as if it had some difficulty bearing it, and bulges faintly appeared on its body.

The large buds around its body that were on the verge of blooming also quietly cracked open at this moment, revealing petals that were originally tightly stacked and closed without a single gap, showing a posture that had never been seen by anyone else in Xu Ran’s eyes.

Now is the time!

Xu Ran’s hands, which were quietly placed on the open petals of the Exquisite Flower King.

Then, those hands, evenly smeared with bath gel, took advantage of the lubrication of the gel to quickly penetrate along the direction of the petals, reaching the deepest part of the slightly opened bud in an extremely short time.

The movements of the Exquisite Flower King froze at that moment.

A depth that had never been reached before caused its body to uncontrollably tremble as if it had been electrified.

The tips of its limbs, smooth as root tips, kept straining to bend at this moment, trembling as if cramping, while the buds all over its body couldn’t help but open further in the trembling, as if expecting Xu Ran to proceed further with the washing and protection.

Indeed, this was the case.

A relaxed smile appeared on Xu Ran’s face.

The Exquisite Flower King is a very peculiar evolution species.

Its original species was the Jade Wood Spirit, a humanoid Pet Beast resembling a wooden puppet, which could evolve along a rare path under certain specific circumstances to become the form it is in now.

Compared to the Jade Wood Spirit, the most distinctive feature of the Exquisite Flower King is the closed buds that fill its entire body.

These buds are also the source of its difficulty in washing and protection.

These buds are not merely decorations on the body of the Exquisite Flower King; once they bloom, the Exquisite Flower King’s power would continuously leak out.

Therefore, the buds around the Exquisite Flower King are usually tightly closed to ensure that its own power does not dissipate.

It is only when the Exquisite Flower King’s own strength is in excess and the vast power needs an outlet that these buds would quietly open a gap.

This, due to the extreme rarity of the Exquisite Flower King species, is likely something it has never realized itself.

And the buds that have always been closed have become a place for dirt and grime to accumulate within the Exquisite Flower King’s body, hiding a large amount of waste secreted from inside it.

If these impurities accumulate too much, they can lead to even more serious problems, causing signs of corrosion to appear uncontrollably on the petals of the Exquisite Flower King’s body.

Such traces not only make the Exquisite Flower King uncomfortable but in more serious cases can even prevent its strength from continuing to increase.

Although this Exquisite Flower King hadn’t reached that point yet, it wasn’t far off.

Luckily, it met Xu Ran.

With Cancan’s immense Earth attribute Power and the Fate Necklace of Stars, Xu Ran easily brought the Exquisite Flower King to a state of power overflow, causing the tight buds to open a gap.

What followed was quite simple.

Feeling the petals that tightly wrapped around his palm and half his forearm, Xu Ran gently rubbed the inner side of the petals.

The touch of fine, chicken-skin-like bumps made his heart sigh slightly, and his gaze towards the Exquisite Flower King softened a few degrees.

“Next, I will take care of it for you,” he said.

After speaking, he gently used his arm and palm to open the closed buds even more and then poured another kind of specially prepared bath gel into the bud.

The cold touch made the violently trembling body of the Exquisite Flower King stiffen slightly, and the continuous electrifying sensation seemed to cool down a bit at that moment.

In exchange was a strange pleasure sensation that it kept revisiting.@@novelbin@@

It could easily feel every single detail of the icy bath gel flowing between the forced-open buds.

As the slippery bath gel kept streaming along the gaps between the petals inside the bud, eventually reaching the unseen bud at the deepest place and completely soaking it in chilliness, the body of the Exquisite Flower King became light and ethereal in an instant.

Its light green eyes suddenly become blurry, the slightly raised head above showed more buds unconsciously blooming, and from its slightly open mouth came an odd and provocative sound uncontrollably.

“Mmm~~”

[Pleasure value from the Exquisite Flower King +50]

[Pleasure value from the Exquisite Flower King +50]

[From…]

Watching the popup of a large amount of pleasure value, Xu Ran’s smile deepened.

However, he did not notice that, with such a violent reaction from the Exquisite Flower King during the washing process, the entire event venue suddenly fell into an eerie quiet.

Many parents with children couldn’t help but cover their children’s eyes, which even included some from Extraordinary Creature Races.

Others who looked at Xu Ran also carried an indescribable strangeness in their eyes.

The other fourteen foster shop bosses from out of town, who had been worried about Xu Ran before, now looked at each other in bewilderment.

“Boss Xu’s performance while washing the Exquisite Flower King… seems to be not bad?” Qi Cang touched his sideburns, his expression gradually becoming strange, “But isn’t the reaction of this wash a bit too exaggerated?”
