Chapter 507: Chapter 286: Beast Emperor’s Well

With the Washing and Protection of the small Earth Lustrous completed, the Withered Wood Elder Clan Leader, acting as the host, gently tapped the ground with his wooden staff.

Accompanying the spread of shallow yellow-green ripples, the Withered Wood Elder kinfolk below, who had received the message, quickly brought up the new members of the second group to perform.

Compared to the previous lone Earth Lustrous, this time the number of new members from the performing tribe was significantly more, totaling seven.

They were seven human-shaped Pet Beasts with a rocky white hue, looking like they had been carved from stone.

They weren’t very tall, approximately one meter in height, and when they stood up, they reached only up to Xu Ran’s waist, with a single horn protruding from the top of their heads.

Earth System Lead Species, Small Rock Creatures.

Unlike their stable, stone-like appearance, these seven Small Rock Creatures were quite lively in character; as soon as they arrived on stage, they couldn’t help but look around curiously, their gaze primarily focused on the various Washing and Protection tools Xu Ran had.

It wasn’t until a slightly dissatisfied “Mmm~” sounded from below that the seven Small Rock Creatures quickly settled down, stood in the prearranged formation, and then began a demonstration of their Skills, which had obviously been rehearsed in advance.

Compared to the demonstration of the lone Earth Lustrous just now, the presentation of the Small Rock Creatures was much more interesting, not only because there were more of them but also because they added some cooperation among each other, balancing strength display with entertainment value.

Watching them, Xu Ran almost thought that they had been trained by a skilled Pet Beast trainer.

When the seven Small Rock Creatures resumed their positions and finished their individual performances, amidst the enthusiastic cheers and shouts from below the stage, Xu Ran, standing atop the platform, couldn’t help but join in with encouraging applause.

The celebration of the wild Transcendent Beings was more interesting than he had imagined.

Of course, it was not ruled out that the wild Transcendent Beings of the Monster Wooden Domain had conceived and thought differently from wild Transcendent Beings in other places due to their long-term contact with humans, which led to the emergence of such human-like community activities.

“Mmm-mm~”

“Mmm~”

Like ones who had just completed a mission, the Small Rock Creatures returned to their lively personalities.

They swarmed toward Xu Ran, staring at him with eager eyes and occasionally uttering urging sounds.

They had already seen the effects of the Washing and Protection on the Earth Spirit Bead.

Now, driven by their curious and active nature, they were eager to try it themselves as soon as possible.

“One at a time, everyone will get their turn,” said Xu Ran with a smile, his gaze sweeping over the seven Small Rock Creatures and quickly settling on one of them, “Let’s start with you.”

“Mmm-mm!”@@novelbin@@

The selected Small Rock Creature pointed at itself in disbelief, then quickly raised its two arms, cheering with joy.

The other six companions cast envious gazes but obediently stood aside, waiting for their selected peer to be washed and groomed first.

“Come over here,” Xu Ran said with a smile, pointing to the Washing and Protection table prepared for the Small Pet Beasts. After the Small Rock Creature lay down, he gently moistened its body with the bath gel he had already prepared.

As the water hit the hard, rock-like body of the Small Rock Creature, its color changed slightly, with deeper blue shades appearing amidst its rocky white.

“Mmm~”

The Small Rock Creature couldn’t help but shiver, feeling a sense of comfort.

At that moment, it felt the warm water flow across its body, infiltrating every joint and mingling with the accumulated deposits that had been making it uncomfortable, softening them.

A sense of comfort and relaxation washed over it.

As Transcendent Beings composed entirely of stone, the Small Rock Creatures had a multitude of joints in their bodies to allow for freedom of movement.

These joints made their stone bodies flexible but also caused them considerable trouble.

Because of their Earth attribute, they were too prone to accumulating dust and dirt.

If the dirt was on the surface of their bodies, it wasn’t too difficult to clean, but if it settled in the joints…

It would not only make the Small Rock Creatures feel clumsy but also difficult to cleanse, compounding over time.

In the long run, the joints of the Small Rock Creatures could even get clogged with this accumulated grime, preventing movement and eventually leading to a complete loss of mobility.

The Small Rock Creatures living in the Monster Wooden Domain were once fortunate to have Mystical Wood Dew as a basis, meaning they didn’t have to worry like their kin on the outside.

However, with the cessation of Mystical Wood Dew, their bodies began to develop problems.

Below the stage, a Small Rock Creature over three meters tall sat with an air of perfect Leadership Stage and a burly body that made it appear quite threatening.

It was the Clan Leader of the Small Rock Creature species.

At this moment, the Small Rock Creature Clan Leader watched intently as Xu Ran began the Washing and Protection, anticipation evident in its eyes.

It hadn’t expected that attending the celebration would bring such a pleasant surprise.

If even their Small Rock Creature species could easily be washed and groomed by this human, then they had a new solution to their joint problems.

But… could it really be done?

The hands of the Small Rock Creature Clan Leader involuntarily clenched into fists.

The next moment, a claw beside it reached out and gently patted the hand of the Small Rock Creature Clan Leader.

It was a slender claw covered in gray-brown long fur.
