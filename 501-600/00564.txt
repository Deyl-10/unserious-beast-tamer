Chapter 564: Chapter 302: Semi-Saint’s Gift! New Beginnings and Farewells!_3

Under the cooperation of the three little ones, even against a Beast King, Xu Ran had the power to fight.

With such strength, in the 47th Beast Field, if not walking sideways, at least there was no need to be excessively cautious and timid.

If possible, Xu Ran hoped that fewer people knew about the Extinct Thunder Attraction the better.

“That’s true.” Thinking of Xu Ran’s strength, Su Yunchuan felt relieved, “With that said, I will take my leave now.”@@novelbin@@

Waving his hand towards Xu Ran, Su Yunchuan turned around and left.

The Monster Wooden Domain had experienced a catastrophe the day before, and now it was recovering from the ruins, with much awaiting revival.

The Demon Wood Semi-Saint expanded the reach of the Monster Wooden Domain to include more areas and showed a momentum for further expansion; in the future, its span would inevitably be larger than now, and perhaps one day, encompassing the entire 47th Beast Field wasn’t impossible.

The news of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood’s breakthrough to become a Demon Wood Semi-Saint spread like the wind throughout the entire 47th Beast Field, attracting more wild Transcendent Beings to come and pledge allegiance.

The original residents needed to re-divide their living areas, and relationships with the new residents also needed to be smoothed out. As the representative of the humans, Su Yunchuan would be very busy in the following days.

This was also a significant reason why he wanted to recruit Xu Ran.

Regrettably, Xu Ran’s ambition was not there.

The system had given him a series of quests to open branch stores and a world map mostly shrouded in fog, which meant he could not settle in one place.

After giving a few last instructions to the three System Clerks, Xu Ran, with his three little companions, turned around and walked out of Monster Wooden City, heading southwest.

Yesterday, upon returning to Monster Wooden City, he had already visited those two Foster Shop owners from Bright Radiance City.

Even though the two owners were still unsettled by the sudden change, they were very pleased to learn of Xu Ran’s purpose and gave him a map to Bright Radiance City.

With the map in hand, Xu Ran’s solo journey through the wild areas swarming with Transcendent Beings outside the Monster Wooden Domain was much more secure, promising a journey with few twists and turns.

After teaching a lesson to a few who were unwise on the road, one human and three pets arrived without too much peril at the place the Azure Hawk Beast King had previously brought them to.

Standing there, they once again saw the small valley hiding the Extinct Thunder Attraction.

Just like the last time they saw it, the valley was still enveloped in misty thunder light, causing the entire mountain to be dyed purple.

Above the valley, there were times when formidable thunderbolts cleaved out of nowhere, without any sign and leaving no trace.

Everything about the place proved that the Extinct Thunder Attraction was still well settled within the valley and hadn’t appeared in the world.

Taking a slight breath of relief, Xu Ran glanced at the map in his hand.

Such an unusual valley was clearly not unknown to the nearby Bright Radiance City, as the map clearly marked the location of the valley and named it “Fallen Thunder Valley.”

Moreover, there were two five-pointed star symbols marked on the location.

This signified that within the range of Fallen Thunder Valley, there lived two Beast Kings, making it extremely dangerous and best to avoid.

And this perfectly corroborated what the Azure Hawk Beast King had mentioned previously.

“Meow~” (My Extinct Thunder Attraction!)

Feeling the familiar aura once again, Ziyun’s eyes suddenly lit up.

It was the one!

The Main Material for Evolution that it had been longing for!

“Don’t be hasty,” Xu Ran patted Ziyun’s head to soothe it, “The Extinct Thunder Attraction has not yet appeared in this world; we can’t get it now, and we shouldn’t alert anyone unnecessarily.”

“We’ll head to Bright Radiance City first.” Taking a deep breath, he shifted his gaze away from Fallen Thunder Valley in front of him, looking towards the towering Second Level Town on the edge of his vision.

Even from a distance, Xu Ran could feel the stringent defenses of this town, which, under a completely different environment for survival than Monster Wooden City, showcased the bearing a Second Level Town should have.

Bright Radiance City, despite being slightly smaller than Xieyun City, didn’t differ much in other aspects. Perhaps because of its proximity to Xieyun City, the two shared many similarities in their construction styles.

As Star sped along, the silhouette of the city rapidly grew in their view, and eventually, Star halted before the towering city gates of Bright Radiance City.

Xu Ran dismounted, took out his Beast Master Badge and other identification materials from his pack, and then entered the city gate with his three small companions.

“Beep beep beep—”

A somewhat urgent sound quickly rang out at the city gate. The next moment, a Beast Master riding a General Level flying pet beast descended from a watchtower in the sky, landing in front of Xu Ran, “A new face, huh? Little brother, did you come from another city?”

“Yes, Monster Wooden City.” Xu Ran calmly presented his documents.

“Monster Wooden City?” The Beast Master checked Xu Ran’s documents and returned them, “No issues with your identity, but I heard the Beast Emperor Sky-reaching Xuanmu became a Semi-Saint, even defeating two other Beast Emperors.”

“When others are hurrying to move to Monster Wooden City, you instead run to our Bright Radiance City?”

“I’m someone who likes traveling,” Xu Ran chuckled.

“…Right.” The Beast Master stepped aside to clear the way, “You need to go to the Beast Master Association of our Bright Radiance City as soon as possible to handle the relevant formalities; otherwise, your Beast Master Points won’t work in our city.”

“I understand all that,” Xu Ran said with an appreciative smile, mounted Star once more, “Could you point me the way? How do I get to the Beast Master Association?”

“Follow this road, it’s at the end,” the Beast Master casually pointed, then watched as one human and three pets transformed into a fleeting shadow disappearing instantly, “The speed’s a bit outrageous, isn’t it?”
