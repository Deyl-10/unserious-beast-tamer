Chapter 541: Chapter 296: You’re Telling Me This Is a Little Turtle?!_4

Compared to the fierce competition on the other platforms, Leaf Fighting Platform Number Three seemed to possess a tranquil peace from years past.

The meditating Xu Ran, the guarding three little ones, and the empty challenger’s platform all seemed as if they would continue this way until the end of the competition.

However, things were clearly not going to go so smoothly.

With the appearance of three Night Bears, cloaked in grey-black fur, slowly climbing up and only now having reached the top ten area, a new storm was imminent.

The three Night Bears had missed the moment when Ziyun and Cancan had splendidly shown their might; at present, they were completely unaware of Xu Ran’s strength.

It was evident that they did not care much about the strength of their opponent.

This is the confidence of a Quasi Emperor species.

They were in no hurry to seize the platform immediately, for it was within their reach whenever they desired.

After reaching the top ten layers, the three Night Bears communicated briefly before the two weaker ones headed straight for Sixth Leaf Blade Arena.

The Sixth Leaf Blade Arena offered rewards suitable for the Dark Attribute, making it ideal for them.

The third bear, who was the strongest of the trio, made its way directly towards Leaf Fighting Platform Number Three.

The sight caused the audience to burst into heated debate once again.

It wasn’t easy.

It was way too difficult.

Finally, there was a contender to break Xu Ran’s defense of the platform!

For some reason, seeing other contenders fighting tooth and nail while Xu Ran meditated calmly, even the audience felt somewhat irritated.

This Night Bear’s arrival was just in time!

The three guardians beside Xu Ran quickly sensed the Night Bear’s presence and woke Xu Ran immediately.

Slowly opening his eyes, a hint of helplessness appeared on Xu Ran’s face.

If possible, he really wanted to meditate this way until the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes ended, then make a swift getaway with the evolution materials for his two Pet Beasts.

Yet, the appearance of the Night Bear was also within his expectations.

“Let Star perform this time,” Xu Ran said with a stretch before sitting up on Star’s back, then took down the rewrapped long saber and slowly uncovered its cloth.

The final moments of the battle against Broken Jade Kite saw Xu Ran wrap the cloth around the saber with flair, and now unwrapping it proved to be quite the hassle.

As it turned out, showmanship comes with a price.

“Xi Lu~” (Leave it to me!)

Star neighed with an excitement that could not be hidden in its eyes.

This was its debut after obtaining its first Four Star Skill, a rare opportunity that had to be seized!

Ziyun and Cancan naturally understood Star’s feelings; among the three, indeed only Star had yet to make a move in the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes.

Therefore, the other two happily left together, heading towards the platform reserved for spectators.

Xu Ran’s choice, as observed by countless spectators, sparked another wave of hot debate.

Undoubtedly, whether it was Ziyun’s explosive output or Cancan’s conspicuous large body type, both left a deep impression on them.

Inevitably, they were also a bit curious about the third Pet Beast beside Xu Ran.

Where there’s a first and second, there must be a third.

What kind of strength did this third Pet Beast possess?

Looking at the person and horse standing on the platform, everyone’s eyes were full of inquiry and curiosity.

Finally, the Night Bear made its way lazily onto Leaf Fighting Platform Number Three atop the Sky-reaching Pillar.

It glanced at Xu Ran and Star before them, with a hint of disdain flashing in its eyes.

The Beast Master, it had encountered them before.

Their reliance was on nothing more than a greater number of Pet Beasts, winning by sheer quantity.

With only one Pet Beast allowed in the battle, it wouldn’t be its match.

If the human had sent out the Pet Beast that had previously thundered down Lei Jing with astonishing speed, it would’ve been more cautious; but as for this one in front of it…

Being of the same Dark Attribute, it could sense the opponent’s general situation.

It seemed that this was not a Dark Attribute Pet Beast adept at dealing damage.

What were those contenders doing before its arrival?

How could they have let such a person successfully hold the arena?

The Night Bear grumbled in its heart as a towering fighting spirit swiftly rose in its eyes.

No matter what, it had taken control over Leaf Fighting Platform Number Three!

“Roar!”

Humans, come and fight!

Swiping a claw in Xu Ran’s direction, the Night Bear instantly transformed into a pitch-black afterimage, lunging toward Xu Ran.

Contrasted with its sluggish performance climbing the Sky-reaching Pillar before, it was now so fast that it was almost invisible, and within just a few breaths, it had closed the distance to a few hundred meters from Xu Ran.

Three Star Skill, Halo Level Shadow Step!

—————–

This Night Bear came at just the right time!

The three little ones guarding Xu Ran quickly sensed the situation with the Night Bear and immediately woke Xu Ran.

Slowly opening his eyes, Xu Ran’s face bore a hint of helplessness.

If possible, he really wished to meditate until the end of the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes, successfully obtain the evolution materials for the two Pet Beasts, and then make his escape.

But the appearance of the Night Bear was also within his expectations.

“Let Star handle it this time,” Xu Ran stretched languidly, flipped over to sit on Star’s back, then took down the long blade he had re-slung across his back, slowly unwrapping the cloth covering it.

As suave as Xu Ran was in wrapping the blade with cloth in the final moments of his battle with the Broken Jade Kite, unwrapping it now was just as troublesome.

As it turns out, showing off comes at a cost.

“Xi Lu~” (Leave it to me!)

Star neighed, hardly concealing the excitement in its eyes.

This was its first debut after acquiring a Four Star Skill, a rare opportunity it must seize!

Ziyun and Cancan naturally understood Star’s feelings, and among the three little ones, only Star had not yet taken action in the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes.

Thus, the two little ones cheerfully paired up to leave, heading to the spectator platform to watch the battle.

Xu Ran’s choice, observed by countless spectators, once again ignited a fierce debate.

Without a doubt, whether it was Ziyun’s explosive offense or Cancan’s strikingly large body type, both left a deep impression on them.

Inevitably, they grew curious about the third Pet Beast that appeared beside Xu Ran.

If there’s a first and a second, then there must be a third.

What kind of strength would this third Pet Beast have?

Looking at the figure of a man and a horse standing on the platform, everyone’s gaze was filled with inquiry and curiosity.

At the top of the Sky-reaching Pillar, the Night Bear finally lumbered onto Leaf Fighting Platform Number Three.

It glanced at Xu Ran and Star in front of it, a trace of disdain flashing in its eyes.

The Night Bear had encountered Beast Masters before.

What they relied on was nothing more than a greater number of Pet Beasts, winning by quantity.

In a situation where only one Pet Beast could be dispatched, it wouldn’t be a match for the bear.

If the human in front of it had sent out the same Pet Beast that had previously traversed Lei Jing with astonishing speed, it might have been a bit more cautious, but as for the one in front of it now…

Being of the same Dark Attribute, it could sense the general condition of its opponent.

This didn’t seem to be a Dark Attribute Pet Beast known for its offensive skills.

What were those contestants doing before it arrived?

How did such a person manage to successfully defend the arena?@@novelbin@@

The Night Bear grumbled in its heart as a towering fighting spirit swiftly rose in its eyes.

No matter what, it had taken control over Leaf Fighting Platform Number Three!

“Roar!”

Humans, come and fight!

Swiping a claw in Xu Ran’s direction, the Night Bear instantly transformed into a pitch-black afterimage, lunging toward Xu Ran.

Contrasted with its sluggish performance climbing the Sky-reaching Pillar before, it was now so fast that it was almost invisible, and within just a few breaths, it had closed the distance to a few hundred meters from Xu Ran.
