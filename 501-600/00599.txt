Chapter 599 - 311: Thunder Peak, Night Of Terror_4

The surging electric light across the mountain was also caused by the rapid swooping of the Thunder Sound Bats.

It seemed that as Thunder Attribute Pet Beasts, they really enjoyed the sensation of stirring up electric light with their movements, even actively moving into the light as if bathing in it.

Even Ziyun, upon seeing the actions of the Thunder Sound Bats, could hardly resist wanting to try it himself.

It looked like quite a bit of fun.

"Don’t forget what we’re here for," Xu Ran tapped lightly on Ziyun’s head and spoke in a lowered voice, "The Thunder Sound Bats have a Two stars Skills called Electric Sound Echo."

"That’s a detection skill, and even Star’s Moon Concealment Star Racing might not be completely undetectable to them."

"So, we need to make our movements as quiet as possible," Xu Ran surveyed the surroundings and then pointed in a different direction, "Let’s go check over there, bypassing this bunch."

"Xi Lu~" (Let’s go.)

Star led the way, stretching the stealth power of Moon Concealment Star Racing to its fullest, cloaking itself, Xu Ran behind it, and the other two little ones.

The man and three Pet Beasts tiptoed past the area where the Thunder Sound Bats were frolicking and soon arrived at another, more secluded and tranquil part of the mountainside.

There, there were several distinct cave entrances, roughly a meter in size, with pitch-black interiors that made it impossible to assess their depth.

Every now and then, Xu Ran could see one or two Thunder Sound Bats flying out from the caves and others from different places entering into them.

Without a doubt, the other side of the caves must be where the Thunder Sound Bats’ nests were located.

"Cha~" (Shall we take a look?)

Cancan was somewhat eager to try.

"Wait a bit longer," Xu Ran shook his head slightly, "The situation is unclear for now, let’s not go in yet to avoid accidents."

"Cha?" (Shall I use Echoing of Earth Vein to probe?) Star suggested, ready to start again from its position, not far from Thunder Peak.

With its speed, it took just a dozen breaths to reach the base of Thunder Peak.

Signaling Star to continue maintaining the stealth power of Moon Concealment Star Racing, Xu Ran dismounted and stood still, looking up towards the mountainside.

It was quite a distance away, and not very clear, but now, as the man and three Pet Beasts arrived at the base of the mountain, he saw more details.

On the fierce-looking rocks, electric light would occasionally explode.

And beneath each flash of electric light, one could glimpse one or two slender and delicate figures.

They were the Thunder Sound Bats.

Clearly seeing those figures with his powerful vision, Xu Ran felt a slight certainty in his heart.

Although the Thunder Sound Bats were not Dark Attribute Pet Beasts, they likewise enjoyed being active at night.

This moment was their most active time.

The surging electric light across the mountain was also caused by the rapid swooping of the Thunder Sound Bats.

It seemed that as Thunder Attribute Pet Beasts, they really enjoyed the sensation of stirring up electric light with their movements, even actively moving into the light as if bathing in it.

The man and three Pet Beasts tiptoed past the area where the Thunder Sound Bats were frolicking and soon arrived at another, more secluded and tranquil part of the mountainside.

There, there were several distinct cave entrances, roughly a meter in size, with pitch-black interiors that made it impossible to assess their depth.

Xu Ran would occasionally see one or two Thunder Sound Bats flying out of the cave entrance, as well as Thunder Sound Bats from other places entering the cave.

Without a doubt, the other end of the cave entrance must be where the Thunder Sound Bats’ nest was located.

"Cha~" (Should we go take a look?)

Cancan seemed eager to try.

"Wait a bit longer," Xu Ran slightly shook his head, "The situation is unclear for now, don’t go in there yet to prevent any accidents."

"Cha?" (Then should I use Echoing of Earth Vein to detect?) The position where Star raised its hoof to depart was not far from Thunder Peak.

With its speed, it took only a dozen or so breaths to reach the foot of Thunder Peak.

Signaling Star to continue maintaining the stealth capability of Moon Concealment Star Racing, Xu Ran dismounted, stood on the spot, and slightly raised his head to look toward the position midway up the mountain.

Being quite a distance away, the details were not clear, but now, with one person and three Pet Beasts arriving at the foot of the mountain, he saw many more details.

On the ferocious rocks, occasionally there would be a flash of electric light.

And with each flash of light, one or two slender and delicate silhouettes were faintly visible.

Those were Thunder Sound Bats.

Seeing those figures clearly with his powerful vision, Xu Ran’s heart steadied slightly.

Although Thunder Sound Bats were not Dark Attribute Pet Beasts, they still preferred to be active at night.

At this moment, it was their most active time.

The surging electric light covering the mountain was also due to the fast swooping of the Thunder Sound Bats.

It was evident that, as Thunder Attribute Pet Beasts, they enjoyed the feeling of stirring up electric light with their movements, to the extent that they would even actively move into the light as if basking in it.

Even Ziyun, seeing the Thunder Sound Bats’ actions, felt somewhat uncontrollable urge to give it a try.

It looked quite interesting.

"Don’t forget what we’re here for." Xu Ran tapped Ziyun’s head lightly and spoke in a low voice, "The Thunder Sound Bats possess a Two stars Skill called Electric Sound Echo."

"It’s a detection skill, and even Star’s Moon Concealment Star Racing may not be able to completely avoid detection by them."

"So, we need to make as little noise as possible," Xu Ran looked around and then pointed in another direction, "Let’s check over there, bypassing this group."

"Xi Lu~" (Let’s go.)

Star walked in front, extending the stealth power of Moon Concealment Star Racing to its fullest, enveloping itself, Xu Ran, and the other two little ones behind it.

One person and three Pet Beasts tiptoed around the area where the Thunder Sound Bats were frolicking, quickly arriving at another more secluded part of the mountain waist.

There, clear cave entrances were visible, about one meter in size, with pitch-black interiors that made it impossible to determine their depth.

Xu Ran would occasionally see one or two Thunder Sound Bats flying out of the cave entrance, as well as other Thunder Sound Bats from other places entering the cave.

Without a doubt, the other end of the cave entrance must be where the Thunder Sound Bats’ nest was located.

"Cha~" (Should we go take a look?)@@novelbin@@

Cancan seemed eager to try.

"Wait a bit longer," Xu Ran slightly shook his head, "The situation is unclear for now, don’t go in there yet to prevent any accidents."
