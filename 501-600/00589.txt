Chapter 589 - 309: Du Qians Visit, A Rare Washing And Protection Subject!_2

```

This experience was a first for him.

Behind Xu Ran, Du Qian, who had remained silent, also showed a hint of surprise on his face.

He too, had recognized the Double-headed Flame Crow at the same time.

However, unlike Xu Ran, he was not completely unfamiliar with this particular Double-headed Flame Crow.

Because it happened to have undergone washing and protection at his place once.

This Double-headed Flame Crow had some differences from the normal ones.

Normally, even though Double-headed Flame Crows have two distinct consciousnesses, these consciousnesses are like twin brothers, very compatible with each other, and they coordinate well, rarely conflicting or quarrelling.

But this Double-headed Flame Crow’s two consciousnesses often conflicted and lacked understanding with each other.

Such anomalies could also affect the washing and protection process.

What one consciousness prefers in terms of washing and protection might not necessarily be liked by the other.

And vice versa.

He still remembered the effort it took to wash and protect this Double-headed Flame Crow. It had taken the strength of nine bulls and two tigers, and in the end, his sister had to step in and lend a hand for it to be successfully completed.

Although it had already been a year since then, and he was not as skilled as he was now, Du Qian still felt somewhat hung up about it.

Glancing at Xu Ran, who was preparing to take on the washing and protection work for the Double-headed Flame Crow, Du Qian hesitated for a moment but ultimately couldn’t help but speak up, "That… the two consciousnesses in this Double-headed Flame Crow... might have some conflicts."

Xu Ran looked at Du Qian in surprise and then carefully observed the Double-headed Flame Crow.

Thanks to Du Qian’s reminder, he quickly noticed that the two heads bathed in the light of fire indeed seemed to have some hostility towards each other.

Sharing a body but not getting along?

Xu Ran’s expression turned somewhat curious.

"So Du Qi is here too." Hearing Du Qian’s voice, the big man only then realized there was a third person in the store.

He wasn’t angry about Du Qian pointing out his pet beast’s problem, just smiled and said, "Since Du Qi has already mentioned it, I won’t hide it."

"Indeed, my Double-headed Flame Crow had a little accident during its evolution, resulting in poor coordination between the two consciousnesses, often leading to conflict…"

At this point, the big man also showed a bit of helplessness, "Often during washing and protection, one consciousness feels comfortable while the other gets restless."

"This has caused the washing and protection to often end prematurely, and I’ve almost been blacklisted by the caretakers." The big man spread his hands, "I heard you are the new ’Cleaning Saint’ and decided to try bringing them here."

"Understood." Xu Ran sent a look of gratitude towards Du Qian.

If Du Qian hadn’t reminded him, this client probably wouldn’t have honestly disclosed these details.

As a result, washing and protecting this Double-headed Flame Crow would undoubtedly add a lot of difficulty.

But... it sounded quite interesting.

"Sir, this is the situation." Xu Ran began slowly, "Du Qi and I are having an exchange about washing and protection, would you mind if we used your pet beast as a case study for our professional exchange?"

"This…" The big man hesitated for a moment, then nodded, "Okay."

He hadn’t taken the initiative to explain his pet beast’s problem at first, which was certainly his fault.@@novelbin@@

But the big man wasn’t trying to give Xu Ran a hard time, he was just worried that Xu Ran would refuse to wash and protect his pet beast if he spoke up.

With some guilt in his heart, it was naturally hard for him to refuse Xu Ran’s request.

Moreover, having Du Qian, who had previously washed and protected the Double-headed Flame Crow, there might make the result of Xu Ran’s washing and protection even better.

"Thank you for your generosity." Du Qian’s smile blossomed as he nodded in appreciation to the big man.

Without a doubt, such a rare washing and protection case held extremely high value for exchange.

"Follow me." Having agreed on the arrangement, Xu Ran gestured for the Double-headed Flame Crow to follow him into the washing and protection room.

"Caw—"

One of the heads of the Double-headed Flame Crow showed an excited and expectant look, quickly stretching towards Xu Ran, as if wanting to follow him into the washing and protection room.

However, the other head twisted towards the direction outside the washing and protection room, appearing somewhat reluctant, as if unenthusiastic about being washed and protected.

Without the cooperation of its sibling, the Double-headed Flame Crow’s flying became stiff and unnatural.

Seeing its sibling not cooperating even for washing and protection, the first head became angry. It glared fiercely at the second head and let out a series of shrill cries, sounding as if it were swearing.

The second head wasn’t one to be bullied, responding with equally harsh cries.

Before even entering the washing and protection room, the two had already begun to argue again.

"Stop arguing and enter the washing and protection room."

In the end, it was the big man’s stern command that made the two heads of the Double-headed Flame Crow temporarily cease their dispute, and the second head stopped being stubborn, obediently cooperating with the first head and flying towards the washing and protection room.

Standing at the entrance of the washing and protection room, Xu Ran watched this scene unfold, suddenly feeling less confident about the washing and protection he was about to undertake.

Earning double the pleasure value seemed a little challenging...

"Welcome back again~"

With the help of the Association, the business on the second day of opening was much busier than Xu Ran had imagined.

After seeing off another satisfied customer, even someone with Xu Ran’s physical endurance began to feel a touch of fatigue.

Looking at the long queue still outside the store, he knew it was time to summon Star.
