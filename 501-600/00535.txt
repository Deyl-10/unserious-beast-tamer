Chapter 535: Chapter 295: Fierce Battle, Defend the Arena_2

However, Ziyun, witnessing this scene, showed no joy on his face.

At the instant when the claw shadows fell, he had already sensed something was amiss. He instantly turned his head, looking in another direction.

A kite bird shimmering with jade-colored light had appeared there at some point and was now hurling toward Xu Ran!

And what the claw shadows enveloped was not the Broken Jade Kite, but merely a piece of jade that turned to powder under the shadows in an instant.

Three Star Skill, Halo Level: Shattered Jade Form!

Among the audience watching the battle from outside the arena, those who were familiar with the abilities of the Broken Jade Kite now had an expression of “as expected.”

Shattered Jade Form was a very strong Substitute Ability of the Broken Jade Kite.

It could not only create decoys to confuse its opponent but also grant a certain degree of concealment to the real body, making it very difficult for the opponent to detect the real body before destroying the decoy.

Luckily, Ziyun was very fast, and its reaction was also strong, otherwise, by the time it destroyed the decoy, the Broken Jade Kite might have already reached Xu Ran.

Even so, the distance between the Broken Jade Kite and Xu Ran was very close now, just a few hundred meters. To the Broken Jade Kite, such a distance was nothing more than a flap of its wings.

Exposed, the Broken Jade Kite no longer maintained the cautious speed that was impaired by fear and suddenly flapped its wings with force, sending a fierce sweep through the void around it!

“Buzz~”

Accompanying the eruption of the Broken Jade Kite’s formidable power, the space around it seemed to distort for a moment as it flapped its wings. The next instant, like an arrow released from a bowstring, it rushed toward Xu Ran with fierce winds.

To deal with a Beast Master, naturally, the weaker Beast Master himself should be the breakthrough point.

While the Broken Jade Kite had great strength, it was also sufficiently cautious.

Only, it seemed to have forgotten something.

Xu Ran and Ziyun didn’t understand its abilities, but did it truly understand the abilities of this duo?

“Zi La—”

Accompanying a sharp explosive sound, electric currents burst forth in the void. Next to Xu Ran, at the point where Lei Jing began, a figure rapidly reformed amidst the lightning, taking on Ziyun’s shape.

Ziyun, which had just landed, didn’t hesitate and raised one of its forepaws to viciously grab at the sky.

The next moment, thunder burst from the clear sky!

An immense bolt of lightning, seemingly born from nowhere, accurately struck toward the jade shadow that was rapidly sweeping through the air.

That almost anticipatory strike seemed poised to collide head-on with the Broken Jade Kite, and its ferocious and inexplicable aura left no doubt that, if struck directly by the lightning, the condition of the Broken Jade Kite would not be good.

“Yi—”

With a sharp cry mixed with a touch of shock and rage, the arrow-like shape of the Broken Jade Kite shifted quickly. It flapped its wings viciously forward, using powerful force to sharply decrease its speed, like slamming on the brakes, to avoid a direct encounter with the bolt of lightning.

The immense kinetic energy made the jade-like patterns on its body even clearer. Such a sudden deceleration during high-speed flight, even for the physically strong Fighting Pet Beasts, was not something easy to withstand.

What made the Broken Jade Kite more uncomfortable was that despite its efforts, it still couldn’t completely dodge this attack.

In the instant the lightning struck the Leaf Arena, it exploded like a nuclear blast, accompanied by a thunderous sound that echoed throughout the venue, spraying countless lightning bolts that danced like Thunder Snakes, sweeping everything within dozens of meters and engulfing the recently halted body of the Broken Jade Kite in an instant.

Four Star Skill, Halo Level: God Lightning Rage Thunder!

Under the first effect of God Lightning Rage Thunder, its full force was displayed at this moment. As a long-range area of effect skill, its strength had already surpassed what was expected of the General Level, causing the audience outside the arena to exclaim repeatedly.

Many customers who had dealt with Starfire Foster Care Shop now looked at the imposing Ziyun, struggling to connect it with the small cat that lay on the counter of Xu Ran’s shop every day.@@novelbin@@

Although by leveraging its special skill, it almost gained the advantage and attacked Xu Ran himself, from what really transpired…

That powerful and mysterious Broken Jade Kite had seemed to be under pressure from the start…

Looking at the dazzling lightning on Arena Three, all the spectators began to feel a bit nervous.

Could the Broken Jade Kite withstand this wave of attacks?

Could it launch another effective offensive?

Under the watchful eyes of the multitude, as the lightning gradually dissipated, the figure of the Broken Jade Kite also became clear in everyone’s view.

Scattered around it were pieces of shattered jade, apparently the result of using some kind of Defense Skill at the moment it was engulfed by the lightning.

However, it was evident that this skill had not completely blocked the attack.

The jade patterns on its body seemed as if they were really shattered, becoming clear and fearsome, and those cyan-green eyes appeared dimmer by several shades.

What further indicated its condition was the slightly listless momentum of the Broken Jade Kite.

The last strike had dealt a heavy blow.

That was despite the Broken Jade Kite reacting promptly, not entering the very center of Astonishing Thunder Fury—the area where it was most powerful.

“Yi—”

With a cry, the Broken Jade Kite spread its wings for the first time, lifted from the ground, and after swooping up a hundred meters into the sky, it stopped, flapping its wings and once again confronting the human and their Pet Beast.

In its eyes surged a profound and serious color.

After an exchange of blows, it had probably grasped the measure of this opponent.
