Chapter 562: Chapter 302: Semi-Saint’s Gift! New Beginnings and Farewells!

“`

Boom!!!

As the Demon Wood Semi-Saint leisurely revealed this little-known secret, Xu Ran’s pupils constricted violently, thunder seeming to roar in his mind.

Originally, he had thought that possessing a brand new Leap Attribute and a significant enhancement in strength was all there was to the uniqueness of the Saint Spirit Race.

He never expected that there was such a specialty in the skills of the Saint Spirit Race.

The Micro Light Level is the seventh stage of Proficiency, the level that comes after the Violent Sun Level, and is the highest skill proficiency level that Xu Ran is currently aware of.

Xu Ran had assumed that there were still higher levels of proficiency, just that he had not reached that stage yet, so he didn’t know what it specifically entailed.

He never expected that this was indeed the final proficiency level.

Having all Talent Skill proficiencies reach the Micro Light Level is a necessary condition for evolving into the Saint Spirit Race.

This matches perfectly with the Evolution Conditions that the system has stipulated within the Evolution Path regarding the requirement for Skill Proficiency.

What further surprised Xu Ran was the method in which the Saint Spirit Race enhanced their strength.

Without new proficiency levels, their way of enhancing strength was to fuse Talent Skills, one by one, into the Wheel of Life of the Saint Spirit, until only the Wheel of Life remained as the sole skill, allowing for a successful breakthrough to the Saint Rank?

In that moment, Xu Ran suddenly recalled that during the lottery drawing with Pleasure value, he had obtained a certain purple item many times.

Talent Skill Fusion Stone!

So far, Xu Ran had never used it, because fusion of Talent Skills could only be attempted by a member of the Emperor Species.

The Talent Skill Fusion Stones he had gradually accumulated were nearly twenty in number, and if what the Demon Wood Semi-Saint said was true, then the importance of this resource would skyrocket tremendously after reaching Emperor Species!

Behind him, the three little ones glanced at each other.

In this moment, they unanimously decided that in the next resource allocation, they must trade away all the previously saved Talent Skill Fusion Stones!

Although they couldn’t use them now, saving them for future use was just perfect!

“Senior, after becoming a member of the Saint Spirit Race, can one fuse skills on their own?” Xu Ran asked softly.

If he were to reach that stage in the future, he could rely on the Talent Skill Fusion Stones to quickly complete the fusion of Talent Skills, but other Transcendent Beings without Talent Skill Fusion Stones must have other methods, as those who had already entered the Saint Rank certainly did.

“Yes,” the Demon Wood Semi-Saint nodded slightly, “As you see, after Transcendent Beings evolve into the Saint Spirit Race, they can use Power to actively remodel themselves.”

“I was able to transform my previous body into what it is now; naturally, I can also fuse Talent Skills with each other.”

“Of course, this process is not simple,” the Demon Wood Semi-Saint’s voice paused slightly, “The fusion of Talent Skills is based on a deeper understanding and control of one’s own Power and requires a long time.”

“I understand,” Xu Ran nodded in realization.

It seemed that even when other creatures could fuse Talent Skills, Talent Skill Fusion Stones still had a strong auxiliary effect.

“Thank you, Senior, for telling me so much that I didn’t know before.” With his doubts dispelled, Xu Ran spoke gratefully.

“There’s no need for thanks, compared to the help you’ve given me, this is but a trifle,” the Demon Wood Semi-Saint gently swayed his body, causing the azure-golden leaves hanging from his branches to rustle softly against each other with a “sasa” sound.

One of the azure-golden leaves fell in response, drifting into Xu Ran’s hands.

“Senior… what is this?” Xu Ran held the leaf cautiously, his heart racing.

After all, this was by no means an ordinary leaf.

Previously, the Demon Wood Semi-Saint had easily helped three Overlord Stage Transcendent Beings to break through to the Emperor Stage with a leaf just like this one. And with two leaves, he had easily slain two old Beast Emperors that had long been famous within Beast Field number 47.

Now, such a leaf in Xu Ran’s hands felt as light as a feather yet as heavy as a thousand catties.

“It’s called the Order Badge,” the voice of the Demon Wood Semi-Saint carried a hint of a smile, “You may consider it as an Epic level tier resource.”

“And its function is quite simple, to change a certain rule within a range for a short time, versatile in use. It can be applied to enhance oneself, to confront enemies, or to other various situations, as long as you can conceive of it.”

“This!!!” Xu Ran gasped sharply, his face showing an expression of immense surprise and joy.

Changing the rules within a range for a short time!@@novelbin@@

He had already witnessed for himself the power that the Demon Wood Semi-Saint could wield with such an ability.

If he used this resource, could he also manifest such a power once?

“Many thanks, Senior!” Xu Ran bowed excitedly to the Demon Wood Semi-Saint, carefully tucking the Order Badge close to his chest.

This was probably the most valuable gift he had ever received.

An Epic level tier resource!

The Demon Wood Semi-Saint nodded slightly, then continued to speak.

“There are a few things to be mindful of when using it.”

“Firstly, only I can truly control the power of Order, so the rule you create with it will indiscriminately affect everything within its range, including yourself.”

“Secondly, the duration of this resource’s effectiveness is determined by the specifics of the rule you set. The more specific the rule you define, and the greater its deviation from the original rules of the world, the shorter its effective time will be.”
