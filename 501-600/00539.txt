Chapter 539: Chapter 296: You’re Telling Me This Is a Little Turtle?!_2

If possible, he hoped he could take his Pet Beast and battle against it!

As this thought crossed his mind, the Hexagram Star Array behind Tuoba Hai flickered rapidly.

The ghost-like Dark Attribute Pet Beast was sent back to its designated spot, and amidst the energy storm sweeping up, the initial Pet Beast that had followed him, a menacing and fierce-looking Fighting Pet Beast, stepped forward.

Fighting King Species, Sickle Stabbing Battle King!

This was Tuoba Hai’s first Pet Beast, as well as the strongest among his four Pet Beasts. More importantly, the Sickle Stabbing Battle King shared a temperament very similar to Tuoba Hai himself.

They both aspired to battle with the strong.

“Come on! Let me see your strength!”

Having summoned his battle Pet Beast, Tuoba Hai shouted at Xu Ran.

“Meow?” (Should I go?)

Seeing a Fighting Attribute opponent, Ziyun moved its paw slightly, a surge of impulse to take action welling up inside. However, remembering Xu Ran’s prior words, it turned its gaze towards Xu Ran, waiting for him to make a decision.@@novelbin@@

“Hmm…” After glancing at the terrifyingly fierce Fighting Pet Beast in the distance, Xu Ran hesitated only for a moment before making up his mind, “Let Cancan go.”

“Huh?” (Me?)

Cancan was momentarily stunned, then excitement sparked in its golden eyes.

Cancan had heard the words spoken by that human called Zhao Tuo as well.

According to Zhao Tuo, this human named Tuoba Hai was likely one of the more threatening challengers at the Leaf Fighting Platform Number Three today.

To face such a challenger, Xu Ran had chosen it. What did that indicate?

It meant Xu Ran recognized its strength!

Cancan, who had seemed somewhat invisible in the team due to Ziyun’s dominance, suddenly felt touched at that moment.

Turns out, Xu Ran had always been aware of its improvements!

With that in mind…

Cancan turned its head, looking towards the opponent who seemed quite threatening.

Let them see the might of Can Emperor!

“Xi Lu~” (Fight on!)

Star, not chosen by Xu Ran, wasn’t disheartened; it glanced at Ziyun and then the two small ones quickly left the arena, ascending the platform of the Sky-reaching Pillar connected to the Leaf Arena and quietly watched the situation in the arena.

Upon witnessing this scene, Tuoba Hai’s expression froze slightly.

He had assumed Xu Ran would send out the Thunder and Fighting Dual Attribute cat Pet Beast from the previous battle.

After all, such a powerful Pet Beast seemed like the opponent’s main Pet Beast.

Unexpectedly, facing him, Xu Ran had dispatched another Pet Beast.

A turtle that seemed to have average strength?

What was this, an underestimation of himself?

In an instant, a wave of anger surged through Tuoba Hai.

Impulsive as he was, he immediately bellowed out.

“Why aren’t you using the Pet Beast from the previous battle? Are you looking down on me?”

“Looking down on you?” A trace of surprise appeared in Xu Ran’s eyes, “Saying that, it seems like you’re the one looking down on my Pet Beast.”

“Huh!” (Underestimated!)

Cancan, beside him, nodded in agreement, a hint of discontent appearing on its face.

What did it mean that switching to it was looking down on him? Was that not thinking it was weaker than Ziyun?

Hmm… although that was true.

But it wasn’t that much weaker, okay!

“Hmph! Then bring it on!”

Having heard Xu Ran’s response, Tuoba Hai spoke no further, though dissatisfaction still lingered in his heart.

Anyone could tell, Xu Ran’s Pet Beast now seemed weaker than the previous one…

Huh?

Watching as its form expanded with the wind, the once inconspicuous little turtle transformed into a beast tens of meters tall in a flash, and its presence continued to climb, rapidly becoming powerful in an extreme amount of time. Tuoba Hai’s expression stiffened.

This guy… what’s happening?!

Those in the audience who were continuously observing Xu Ran’s side, particularly those who had dealt with Starfire Foster Care Shop and weren’t strangers to that little turtle, also echoed the cry of shock.

That was clearly a harmless little turtle with a very friendly nature, even taking the initiative to greet customers. Why did it suddenly change this much?

And in the next moment, both Tuoba Hai and the audience realized they had been surprised too soon.

Because tens of meters tall, a size that could easily qualify for a Super Large Size Pet Beast, was not the “little turtle’s” limit.

Fifty meters… a hundred meters… two hundred meters… three hundred meters!

Reverting from its reduced state to its original size, Cancan’s transformation paused briefly. At the same time, its enormous aura, befitting the General Level pinnacle, surged skyward, sweeping towards Tuoba Hai.

For some reason, looking up at the beast akin to a small mountain, Tuoba Hai breathed a sigh of relief.

He had almost thought the creature could keep growing indefinitely…

Now, it seemed, this was its limit.

Feeling Cancan’s not-so-weak presence at this moment, Tuoba Hai’s previous anger faded.

It seemed the young man in front of him hadn’t lied; this Pet Beast’s strength probably wasn’t weak either.

“Sickle Stabbing, attack!”

With a low shout, Tuoba Hai drew two curved blades from his waist and charged towards Cancan together with Sickle Stabbing Battle King.

Having received the feedback from his four General Level pinnacle Pet Beasts, Tuoba Hai’s own strength had also touched upon the General Level, though much weaker than Sickle Stabbing Battle King, he could still barely keep up with its pace.

Fighting side by side, man and Pet Beast, such a sight was relatively rare among Beast Masters, but seeing that it was Tuoba Hai, the combat maniac, it made perfect sense to everyone.
