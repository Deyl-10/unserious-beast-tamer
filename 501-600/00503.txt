Chapter 503: Chapter 284 Speculation and Celebration Opening

“`

“Born from death?”

After much effort, Xu Ran finally understood this somewhat complicated paraphrase, and a contemplative look appeared on his face.

Indeed, the Beast Emperor Sky-reaching Xuanmu seemed to have expectations for its own actions.

It knew what would happen if it continued to expand the size of its body, and yet it persisted.

Perhaps the secret lies within these four words.

Born from… death!

“So… The Sky-reaching Xuanmu may have encountered some trouble that forced it to do so?” Xu Ran stroked his chin, speculating, “This could explain the meaning of ‘born from death,’ but what is ‘order’ then?”

“Xi Lu?” (Could it be referring to the order of the Monster Wooden Domain?)

Star, also deep in thought, suddenly spoke up, asking.

“The order of the Monster Wooden Domain…” Xu Ran slightly lifted his head and glanced at the distant and magnificent yet completely still Sky-reaching Xuanmu, which stood silent like a real tree, “That assumption does have some possibilities.”

Within the Monster Wooden Domain, there was a stability not found in other Beast Fields.

Here, wild Transcendent Beings didn’t engage in terrible upheavals; even though the primal food chain still existed, and some Transcendent Beings fed on others, they only hunted what they needed and didn’t wantonly slaughter.

Furthermore, the friendly and harmonious coexistence between Transcendent Beings and humans was absolutely unseen elsewhere.

Here, something existed that was absent in other parts of the Beast Field.

It was something called order.

Indeed, because the Sky-reaching Xuanmu occupied this area and established new rules with the majesty of the Beast Emperor, this territory gradually became such a paradise.

For the Sky-reaching Xuanmu itself, this was probably something it cared about deeply.@@novelbin@@

After all, it had expended much energy to create this Monster Wooden Domain.

But…

What did this have to do with its ‘born from death’?

Xu Ran’s mind was filled with various speculations in an instant, but he always felt there was a lack of some key factor, preventing him from seeing the truth of the matter.

“Forget it, the matters of the Beast Emperor level are beyond my comprehension.” Xu Ran shrugged helplessly and then turned to the Ground Raccoon Clan Leader, “The place for the celebration shouldn’t be far from here, right?”

While they were chatting, the Monster Wooden City had completely vanished from sight.

Hearing this, the Ground Raccoon Clan Leader turned his head to look around, quickly figuring out their current location, and then nodded at Xu Ran.

“Loo~”

The location of the celebration was very close.

Xu Ran nodded in understanding, his eyes filled with expectation.

Judging from the direction they were heading and the position of the Beast Emperor Sky-reaching Xuanmu, the place of the celebration should be right in the core domain of the Monster Wooden Domain.

The core domain of the Monster Wooden Domain was the area enveloped by the sweeping canopy of the Beast Emperor Sky-reaching Xuanmu, spanning dozens of kilometers.

The lush canopy formed an umbrella that obscured the sky, starkly separating the world beneath it from the world outside.

Even without having visited this area before, Xu Ran had heard of it.

The core domain of the Monster Wooden Domain consisted of two layers.

Beneath the canopy was the Shady Layer, where the dense foliage of the Sky-reaching Xuanmu blocked the sunlight, allowing only sparse light to trickle through.

Numerous wild Transcendent Beings that enjoyed cool environments lived here. Whenever they looked up at the overbearing leaves of the Sky-reaching Xuanmu, they felt a deep sense of security.

The canopy of the Sky-reaching Xuanmu was the second layer, the Canopy Layer, and it hosted an intricate network of branches that was a paradise for arboreal Transcendent Beings.

They built their own nests at the junctures of branches, living and moving among the treetops year-round.

The Sky-reaching Xuanmu not only allowed this behavior but also actively adjusted its branches to make them more suitable for nest-building.

Even though the Sky-reaching Xuanmu had nearly stopped responding to the beings within the Monster Wooden Domain, this kind of adjustment still took place.

As they neared, Xu Ran could clearly see more details of the exaggeratedly large canopy of the Sky-reaching Xuanmu.

Every leaf of the Sky-reaching Xuanmu was of a neatly uniform circular shape, giving the impression that even their sizes were identical.

Complex light green patterns spread over its deep brown branches, which were also quite symmetrical, even presenting an easily discernible symmetry.

Observing the body details of the Sky-reaching Xuanmu up close, Xu Ran couldn’t help but frown slightly.

A remarkable sensation of dissonance emanated from the Sky-reaching Xuanmu.

The growth of normal trees’ branches should be irregular, and even though leaves typically have a similar shape, just like human fingerprints, no two leaves are exactly the same.

These theoretical norms were not manifested on the Sky-reaching Xuanmu.

Its branches were overly symmetrical, and every single leaf was a perfect circle…

He wondered if this peculiarity was the result of deliberate adjustment by the Sky-reaching Xuanmu or if it was naturally so.

“Cha!” (We’re going in!)

Cancan let out a low cry and then rose from the earth, revealing its entire body, stepping into the suddenly darkening Shady Area ahead.

On the way here, the Ground Raccoon Clan Leader had warned them that within the core domain of the Monster Wooden Domain, they could not use any skills to enter beneath the earth.

This was the sole taboo of the core domain of the Monster Wooden Domain.
