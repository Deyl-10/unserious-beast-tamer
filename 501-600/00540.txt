Chapter 540: Chapter 296: You’re Telling Me This Is a Little Turtle?!_3

Standing atop Cancan’s head, Xu Ran looked down at the man-and-beast duo charging towards him, arms crossed, exuding the demeanor of a master.

“Cancan, keep going.”

“Chaa~” (Understood!)

With a roar that echoed throughout the entire arena, Cancan’s body abruptly expanded once more from its original state.

Five hundred meters… one thousand meters… one thousand five hundred meters…

As its body continued to swell, Cancan’s momentum climbed steadily. Although it wasn’t as rapid as when it reverted to normal size, it was still impressively quick.

By the time it expanded its body to over two thousand meters, reaching the limit of the Mustard Xumi Current Stage, its momentum had increased by two to three times, surpassing the scope of the General stage and faintly touching upon the King Stage level.

With its expansion came extreme sluggishness in movement, but to others who were unaware of this, the sight was beyond shocking.

Keep in mind, the size of an arena at the General stage is only about three thousand meters in diameter.

The arenas in the top ten are slightly larger, with a diameter of only four thousand meters.

And now, this Transcendent Being, by merely standing there, occupied nearly a third of one competition area.

The entire Leaf Arena Number Three seemed to sag under its colossal size.

How…

How do you fight this?

The same question arose not only in the minds of the spectators but also in the mind of Tuoba Hai, who, as Xu Ran’s opponent standing in the arena, along with the Sickle Stabbing Battle King, had halted their original charge.

Gazing up at the shadow overhead, both man and beast swallowed their saliva in unison.

Although size and strength aren’t always equivalent,

with such a size, would you believe it if someone said it wasn’t powerful?!

“Sss?”

The Sickle Stabbing Battle King turned to its Beast Master and uttered an inquiring sound.

Are we still fighting or not?

It enjoyed battling the strong,

but it didn’t enjoy being beaten one-sidedly!

Facing Cancan, whose oppressive form was slowly lowering its head, and Xu Ran, who looked tiny on Cancan’s head but was a presence no one dared to ignore, Tuoba Hai forcefully swallowed his saliva.

“Fight!”

…One second later…

Observing Tuoba Hai and the Sickle Stabbing Battle King who were both ejected from the arena, held aloft on an invisible light film, and delivered to a nearby platform, silence fell over the entire venue.

Even participants on other arenas couldn’t help but frequently glance towards Xu Ran’s location, internally relieved that they weren’t the ones targeted.

Wasn’t this cruelty?

Since when did the Monster Wooden Domain produce such an immensely powerful Beast Master?!

As the battle concluded, Cancan rapidly shrank down from its form that occupied half the arena, reverting to a portable size of about one meter.

Seeing this, no one dared to underestimate the seemingly ordinary little turtle any longer.

If provoked, it truly could morph into a Giant Beast in an instant…

Compared to Ziyun, Cancan consumed less energy.

This was an arena constructed by the Beast Emperor Sky-touching Mysterious Wood. Although it was accommodating to other Attributes, the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood itself was of the Earth attribute, granting Earth attribute Pet Beasts some extra consideration here.

Hence, after the light film rose, within just a few breaths, Cancan had completely recovered.

“After this, we should get some temporary relief,” said Xu Ran with a smile, looking at the three little ones who had regrouped.

After both Ziyun and Cancan displayed such formidable strength, anyone wishing to climb the arena to claim the throne would have to measure the difference in their powers first.

If they rationally forfeited, they could retain their strength to contend for a lower-ranked arena.

If they insisted on challenging and incurred injuries and depletion they could not rapidly recover from, they might have to leave the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes empty-handed.

The three little ones nodded in unison.

Although not being able to clash with more opponents was a bit regrettable for them since their strength had only recently advanced,

the fact that they could more easily obtain the evolution materials for Ziyun and Star was undoubtedly a good thing.

Once the light film dissipated, the situation was much as Xu Ran had anticipated.

The figures that were previously standing outside the arena, waiting for their turn to challenge, had not increased. Instead, there were only a sparse one or two remaining.

When they caught Xu Ran’s gaze, even these few indecisive waiters seemed to make up their minds, turning away to head to other arenas.

This left no challengers waiting to fight for the throne.@@novelbin@@

“Completely free,” Xu Ran commented upon seeing this and casually spread his hands towards the three little ones. He then casually sat down cross-legged on the spot.

Even without the dense energy and the aura of life within the light film, being a part of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood, the Leaf Arena had its own abundant energy along with a faint fragrance that could stabilize emotions.

It was an excellent place for meditation.

Slowly closing his eyes, Xu Ran entered a state of meditation in front of countless spectators and contestants.

The three little ones stood guard around him, assuming protective stances, and quietly waited.

Compared to the life-and-death struggles happening on other arenas, especially the top ten, the scene on Leaf Arena Number Three was quite peculiar.

So much so that many spectators, while watching other battles, couldn’t help but sneak glances at arena number three.

This guy… he’s not really going to meditate until the end of the contest, is he?!

Time ticked by, second by second.

In the top ten Leaf Arenas, barring number three, almost every single one had undergone more than ten bouts of combat. Among these arenas, there were few where the lord had not changed.
