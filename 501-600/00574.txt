Chapter 574 - 305 Du Huayans Letter_3

As he was speaking, behind him the Hexagram Star Array flickered, and a Pet Beast that somewhat resembled a golden mushroom rapidly appeared.

Light Attribute, Transcendent Stage — Leader Species, Golden Mushroom.

Liu Cang was also a Beast Master, except his talent was quite ordinary, and he didn’t harbor a strong desire to become more powerful. He had contracted a Light Attribute Pet Beast with healing capabilities to assist with his grooming work.

Following Liu Cang’s reach towards the Golden Mushroom, it skillfully released a puff of light mist, enveloping his wrist.

In a warmth-filled moment, Liu Cang instantly felt the soreness in his wrist greatly relieved.

"Hehe, it’s good to have you," Liu Cang said, patting the Golden Mushroom’s head once the treatment finished, his face showing a bit of longing. "If a Beast Master becomes stronger, their physical condition improves, making grooming more efficient."

"It’s a pity that powerful Beast Masters disdain the work of a Caretaker."

At this point, Xu Ran’s figure suddenly popped into Liu Cang’s mind.

That somewhat unfamiliar young man, he must be a formidable Beast Master, right?

With three Pet Beasts, he must be at the Leadership Stage, right?

And he’s still so young...

A hint of envy appeared in Liu Cang’s eyes.

That young man’s grooming efficiency was probably much higher than his own.

But still...

When it comes to grooming techniques, of course, he was the stronger one!

Thinking this, a bit more smugness crept into Liu Cang’s eyes, as if regaining some self-confidence.

He pushed himself off the ground with both hands and stood up. "Let’s go, Jin. Come with me to take a look outside."

Liu Cang had a habit. Once he started a grooming session, he would not leave the grooming room midway.

So from the first customer, he remained in his little corner, and even for calling in the next customer, he would have the previous one do it.

At this moment, he was suddenly curious about how long the queue outside his door had become and... what was the situation like in the other grooming rooms.

Presumably, the line of customers waiting outside his grooming room should be the longest in the nearby area, right?

Even though this location was rather remote, since the grooming exhibition had been running for a while, there should have been quite a few customers waiting at the entrance who became impatient and decided to look deeper inside for a grooming room.

Thus...

With his hands on the grooming room’s door, Liu Cang’s face revealed some expectation.

Daring to guess, could there be twenty customers lined up at the door?

With this thought, Liu Cang swung the door open.

Then, the smile on his face stiffened slightly.

One...two...three...four...

Only a mere four people were queued outside the door.

-----------------

The Caretaker room personally recommended by Du Qian was somewhere they wanted to try.

Watching that scene, Du Qian smiled faintly, threw the megaphone to his assistant, and turned to walk into the grooming room.

The assistant blinked and hurriedly followed.

"Qi An, why do this?" He complained somewhat bafflingly. "It’s one thing to push queued customers away, but why specifically recommend another Caretaker to them? Isn’t that feeding the competition?"

"This is your first time participating in the grooming exhibition as the Chief Groomer of the Hundred Flowers Foster Store, succeeding your sister. Winning the title ’Cleaning Saint’ is very important for you!"

"I know." Du Qian smiled and started cleaning the grooming table, readying for the next grooming session.

"Let me do it," the assistant said as he stepped forward to take over, complaining while he cleaned. "If you know this, why still do it? That ’Starfire Foster Care Shop’ I haven’t even heard of, so why help them?"

Du Qian remained silent but smiled, watching the assistant tidy up while grumbling, and he couldn’t help recalling the letter his sister had sent him the other days.

Because of the invitation from the Monster Wooden City Beast Master Association, his sister, who had been the Chief Groomer at the Hundred Flowers Foster Store, represented the Du family of Bright Radiance City and opened a branch of Hundred Flowers Foster in Monster Wooden City, which in turn led to his promotion to Chief Groomer.

His sister, now in Monster Wooden City, hadn’t cut off contact with Bright Radiance City; she would regularly send letters back home, sharing her experiences in Monster Wooden City and expressing her care and greetings for the family.

In his sister’s last letter, Du Qian noted something his sister mentioned that caught his attention.

In Monster Wooden City, there was a Foster Shop called Starfire Foster.

The owner of that shop, like his sister, wasn’t a local of Monster Wooden City but had moved there at the invitation of the Monster Wooden City Beast Master Association to open a branch.

In the letter, his sister repeatedly described the other party’s grooming techniques as "magical," "ingenious," and "astonishing," and mentioned that the person was also a youth.

This made Du Qian mentally note down this Foster Shop and regret that since it wasn’t in Bright Radiance City, he couldn’t witness the grooming skills for himself.

And now, here he was in Bright Radiance City, hearing the same name.

Combining that with the astonishing condition of the girl’s Pet Beast after grooming, Du Qian had at least a seventy percent certainty that this was the person his sister mentioned.

Although he didn’t know why this person had appeared here, his desire to witness the other’s grooming skills was likely to be satisfied.@@novelbin@@

No, merely witnessing wasn’t enough.

How could he not directly compete against such an impressive Caretaker?

Did he end up with a bad location in the lottery, resulting in slow business?

No problem, I’ll share my customers with you!

He wanted to see who, under the same saturated customer flow, could win more approval from the Beast Master clients through their grooming.
