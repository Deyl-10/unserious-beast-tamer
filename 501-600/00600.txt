Chapter 600 - 312: Slashing The Bat King!

[Editing in progress, check back tomorrow]

A hint of anticipation flickered through the eyes of the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King.

After guarding against the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow for over a year, it had a thorough understanding of its adversary’s abilities, estimating its own chances of winning a fight to the death at about sixty percent.

Therefore, it was certain to be the one to have the last laugh.

It had already decided that after taking the Extinct Thunder Attraction, it would lead its race once more to migrate, seeking out a secluded and safe location to earnestly attempt evolving into the Emperor Species.

Beast Field No. 47 was about to hear the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King’s proclamation!

"Squeak~~"

For the coming two months, I shall not return.

Looking at his wife, the Queen of the race, the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King spoke thusly.

The last two months were of utmost importance, not tolerating the slightest negligence.

A look of reluctance was in the eyes of the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat Queen, but it also understood how vital that resource was to its husband and their whole race.

After prattling a few words of advice and blessings, the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat Queen watched the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King depart before returning with the majority of the Thunder Sound Bat Race.

"Xi Lu!" (They’re here!)

With a fervent neigh, Star pierced the pitch-black night, its echo resounding through the desolate valley.

Its eyes, now entirely transformed into pure black with mysterious chains intertwined within, gazed intently at a rapidly enlarging speck on the horizon, glimmering with a strange radiance.@@novelbin@@

Three Star Skill, Halo Level - Night Inspection.

This skill, developed and elevated through fusion, now had numerous uses, but that didn’t interfere with its original function of enhancing eyesight.

In the darkness of night, it remained Star’s most advantageous surveillance method.

"Hmm?"

Startled from meditation, Xu Ran immediately opened his eyes and followed Star’s gaze, leaping without hesitation from the large stone upon which he was seated onto Star’s back.

"Ziyun!"

"Meow!" (They’re here!)

Ziyun, already tensed and ready to spring at Star’s warning, responded with a cry and its aura rapidly shifted. Its slender body transformed in an instant into a white and purple longsword that seemed as though it could slice through the void.

Four Star Skill, Halo Level - Immortal Body!

"Xi Lu Lu~"

With a neigh, Star’s starlight converged from the void, twisting into invisible chains linking it to Xu Ran. In an instant, the auras of the man and beast blended as one, their power skyrocketing like a rocket!

Three Star Skill, Halo Level - Fated Star Pulling!

Yet, this was still not the end!

Amidst the profound darkness and the bright starlight woven together, layer upon layer of splendid radiance that resembled the starry sky showered down on Star and Xu Ran, propelling their power to surge once again!

Four Star Skill, Halo Level - Prayer of Starry Night!

Holding strength at its peak, Xu Ran uttered a low command and grabbed Ziyun, now in the form of a longsword, his eyes flashing with a sharp light.

In that moment, his aura became deep and piercing, while at the tip of the longsword, the radiance formed an edge that seemed capable of piercing the heavens!

"Cha!" (Leave the battlefield to me!)

Cancan barked, and a torrential earthy yellow halo surged around him before sweeping across the land like a fierce wave and spreading far into the distance.

Its body swiftly enlarged, not continuing to grow immense but reverting to its original body type, resembling a small hillock, firmly defending by Xu Ran’s side!

Nodding towards Cancan and beholding the figure becoming clearer in the void, Xu Ran took a deep breath and, without hesitation, swung the longsword!

"Clang!!!"

A resonant sword cry shattered the stillness of the night!

A blade of concentrated thunder as its edge and the dark, profound night as its body tore through the sky, ruthlessly striking at the unsuspecting Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King!

That night was startling!
