Chapter 528: Chapter 293: Huh? Boss Xu?!

“Good morning, Boss Xu!”

“Boss Xu, are you going to watch the competition again today?”

“Eh? What’s that you’re carrying on your back, Boss Xu?”

“…”

Continuously responding to the greetings from customers, Xu Ran cheerfully walked out of the Starfire Foster Care Shop with the thunderous long sword wrapped in cloth on his back, along with his three little companions.

Before long, after making his way through the crowd of customers, he swung himself onto Star’s back and raced towards the city gates like the wind.

At the gates of Monster Wooden City, a remarkably unified swarm of people formed a thick, long queue, heading straight to today’s Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes venue.

This was already the third day of the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes.

Having witnessed the grandeur of the Elite Stage battle of the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes two days ago, Xu Ran did not miss yesterday’s Leadership Stage battles either.

He saw the competition venue expand several times overnight and also watched the fiercer battles, witnessing the birth of the top hundred leaders of the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes before returning home satisfied.

Today, unlike the previous two days where he sat in the audience as a spectator, Xu Ran would be personally participating in the General Stage level of the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes.

Thanks to the last two days of watching the competition, he and his three companions had gained quite an understanding of the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes, so even though it was their first time competing, they wouldn’t feel entirely unfamiliar with it.

In place of that unfamiliarity, there was a strong sense of anticipation.

This anticipation stemmed not only from the opportunity to acquire the Main Material for Evolution for both Star and Ziyun during the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes, but also from the intense competitive atmosphere of battle that ignited their passion and combat spirit.

To perform better in the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes, Xu Ran even brought with him the long sword acquired from Thunderbolt Half Mountain, which he seldom carried.

Following the large contingent, one man and his three beasts quickly arrived at the competition venue they had visited the previous two days.

Although it was the same place, the competition venue had expanded significantly overnight, leaving both Xu Ran and the other spectators with a sense of familiar unfamiliarity.

What had been the Leaf Arena with a 300-meter diameter two days before, had now expanded to a 3,000-meter scale, increasing a hundredfold in size. The Sky-Reaching Pillar that supported these arenas had become immensely spectacular, piercing the clouds and holding up the sky.

“I can hardly imagine what tomorrow’s competition venue will look like,” Xu Ran muttered to himself, craning his neck with effort just to catch a glimpse of the top of the Sky-Reaching Pillar.@@novelbin@@

The venue for tomorrow’s King Stage level of the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes would reach its largest scale, nearly matching the size of the Sky-Touching Mysterious Wood itself.

At that time, the audience will be situated on the body of the Sky-Touching Mysterious Wood.

It is said that will be the most bustling day of the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes.

“Cancan!” (We must come to watch the competition tomorrow!)

Gazing up at the ever-expanding competition venue, Cancan exclaimed excitedly.

Due to its large body type, it instinctively had a special fondness for gigantic things. While the Leaf Arena was already quite big, in Cancan’s eyes, it was still not quite enough.

Now, if it could revert to its original body type, it would reach a 300-meter scale, and if it were to fully utilize Jiezimixu to further enlarge its body type, it could even reach two to three thousand meters. This Leaf Arena wouldn’t be enough for it to stretch out in!

Therefore, it wanted to see what tomorrow’s competition venue would look like.

Although it wouldn’t be able to participate at that time, having a look would be good too!

“Meow~” (Let’s first focus on winning today’s competition smoothly.)

Ziyun raised a paw and gently tapped Cancan’s head, revealing a bit more solemnity in its eyes.

Although it was confident about successfully defending Leaf Fighting Platform Number Three in the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes, the leaf rewards were tied to its Evolution Materials, and it could not afford to lose them!

“Xi Lu~” (Indeed, we should focus on today’s match first.)

Star neighed in agreement with Ziyun’s words.

Tomorrow’s matters could wait until tomorrow. Today’s resources had to be secured first!

This wasn’t just about Ziyun’s evolution; it was also crucial for his own evolution.

“Don’t worry, we’ll definitely come tomorrow,” Xu Ran said with a smile, patting Cancan’s head. “We’ve been here for the last three days; how could we miss the most exciting fourth day?”

“But for now…” Xu Ran looked around and soon spotted the Gigantic Spirit Ostrich from the past two days, handling the competitors’ check-in with a special wreath on its head. “It’s getting late; we should go check in now.”

“Gah~”

Watching Xu Ran and his three companions approach, the Gigantic Spirit Ostrich let out a low grunt, tilted its head, and motioned for Xu Ran and his little trio to present their participation certificates.

Xu Ran, who had previously picked up the corresponding certificate from the Beast Master Association, quickly fumbled out a distinctive Certificate Stone from his chest and handed it over.

Though it appeared to be a common, even irregular, stone, it bore the unique aura of the Beast Emperor Sky-reaching Xuanmu, impossible for anyone to counterfeit.

The Gigantic Spirit Ostrich lowered its long neck, sniffed at the Certificate Stone, swallowed it with a gulp amidst Xu Ran’s twitching lips, showing a satisfied expression, then pointed with its beak to a nearby passage, indicating that Xu Ran should enter.

The competitors’ check-in was completed just like that, simply and swiftly.

This scene caught the attention of many nearby people.

“Hey, isn’t that Boss Xu? Why is he participating in the competition as well?” A Beast Master from Monster Wooden City, who had come to watch the competition, tapped his companion’s shoulder.
