Chapter 576 - 306: The Allegiance Of Holy Hands, Irony

The door to the washing and protection room opened once again under Du Qian’s watchful gaze.

Xu Ran, who had just seen off another customer under the moonlight, came out and waved to the somewhat restless and excited customers behind him, then cupped his hands around his cheeks and spoke up clearly.

"Everyone, thank you for your support and trust in me and the Starfire Foster Care Shop. Until the end of the cleaning and caring exhibition, this washing and protection room will remain open."

"It’s getting late now, please be mindful of the time, and don’t let waiting in line delay your other affairs. Rest assured, I will be here."

His words caused the queuing crowd to stir once more.

Working tirelessly to wash and protect for everyone without earning a single penny, such dedication from a caretaker was truly admirable.

Some clients, who were hesitant about continuing to queue because of the late hour, felt reassured like taking a calming pill after hearing these words, and chose to wait without hesitation.

Others were also reassured and decided to come back early in the morning to queue, opting to leave for now.

After a moment of commotion, the number of people in line decreased, but the eyes of the waiting customers looking towards Xu Ran were filled with expectation.

"Next, please."

Seeing this, Xu Ran smiled and spoke, then turned and entered the washing and protection room.

Not far away, Du Qian, standing in the shadows, fell silent.

Was this the cleaning master his sister had mentioned, the one who was even more excellent than himself?

He suppressed the urge to step forward and converse with Xu Ran, turning instead towards his own washing and protection room.@@novelbin@@

Keep it up!

If others can stay up all night, so can I!

-----------------

Time flew rapidly amidst the bustling cleaning and caring exhibition.

With a good start on the first day, Xu Ran’s washing and protection room achieved full, non-stop service with no idle time on the second day.

With the cooperation of Ziyun and Star, even after washing and protecting continuously for two days and one night, he hardly felt tired at all.

And Cancan, who kept watch outside the door, was not completely without use.

Its body, enlarged to about fifty meters, was quite conspicuous, taller even than the washing and protection rooms provided by the organizers, attracting more passersby Beast Masters while also deterring the petty thieves.

With the full cooperation of one person and three pets, the renewed appearance of more and more pet beasts of the Beast Masters walking in the street caught countless eyes, and more and more Beast Masters learned about the amazing skills of this unfamiliar caretaker at the cleaning and caring exhibition.

As a result, the reputation of Starfire Foster Care Shop spread even before officially starting its business.

Soon, the evening of the second day of the cleaning and caring exhibition arrived.

With the tolling of a bell that resounded throughout the venue, wails of disappointment emanated from the crowds outside the doors of each cleaning and protection room.

These cries came from the Beast Masters who had queued for a long time but still hadn’t had their turn.

Because with the ringing of that bell, the pet beast cleaning and caring exhibition had ended.

They had missed the free services and would now have to pay for cleaning at the Foster Shop.

When the bell tolled, Xu Ran was washing and protecting a customer’s pet beast.

Hearing the bell, the customer’s face suddenly lit up with happiness, "Looks like I’m in luck, just in time for the last slot."

"The last slot?" Xu Ran turned to glance at the customer with a touch of confusion in his eyes, "Why is it the last slot?"

"Huh? Mr. Xu, you didn’t know?" the customer asked, surprised, "The ringing of the bell signifies the end of the exhibition."

"According to the rules of the exhibition, if the cleaning is not finished when the bell rings, it can continue, and the customer can still give a rating to the caretaker."

"But for the caretaker’s subsequent customers, they cannot give ratings, meaning it won’t affect the outcome for the ’Cleaning Saint’ title," the customer scratched his head, "That title should be quite important to you guys, right?"

"For me, the title is indeed very important," Xu Ran nodded slightly, at the same time recalling the scene when he had sent off the previous customer and the current one had entered.

Perhaps knowing that there wasn’t much time left until the end of the exhibition, several had given up queuing, and the line had shortened considerably, leaving only a dozen or so customers.

With that thought, Xu Ran slowly spoke, "But customers are more important than titles."

"Your pet beast is all clean now."

"Eh? Done!"

The customer’s attention quickly shifted to his own pet beast. He stood up and hurried forward, gazing at the fluffy little hamster pet beast in Xu Ran’s hands, his face showing a look of delight.

"Boss Xu, this is the first time I’ve seen my Golden Eye Rat styled like this, it’s fantastic!" he said while carefully picking up his pet, eyes brimming with affection.

"As long as you’re happy," Xu Ran smiled, quickly tidied up the washing and protection table, then walked towards the door of the room.

Seeing Xu Ran’s actions, the customer snapped out of it and quickly followed, starting to inquire, "Boss Xu, when you said customers are more important than titles, what did you mean by that?"

"That..." Xu Ran didn’t answer directly but simply smiled and then opened the door to the washing and protection room, addressing the people standing still with sighs, ready to leave, "Those of you who were queuing before, please don’t leave. I will continue to provide free washing and protection."

"Of course, those who queue up afterwards won’t be included."

"Next, please."

After a moment of silence, the customers waiting outside Xu Ran’s washing and protection room burst into cheers, grateful they hadn’t given up too soon.

The customer at the very front of the line was as ecstatic as if he had won the lottery, walking up to Xu Ran and thanking him repeatedly.
