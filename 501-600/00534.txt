Chapter 534: Chapter 295 Fierce Battle, Defending the Arena

Because the chosen Leaf Arena was so high, by the time Xu Ran climbed onto Leaf Fighting Platform Number Three, the battles at the other leaf arenas below had already started one after another.

The first few arenas that started the contest had even finished their fights, determining the first champion, and entered into the mid-battle rest period within the light films that rose from the arenas.

However, no matter how exciting these battles were, when Xu Ran stepped onto Leaf Fighting Platform Number Three and confronted the Broken Jade Kite poised on the same platform, the majority of the crowd’s attention turned their way.

After all, the higher the Leaf Arena, the more likely it was to feature stronger competitors and more intense, thrilling battles.

And the two about to begin their fight were particularly interesting.

One of them had arrived at Demon Wood Domain about half a year ago, and with his robust strength, soon made a name for himself; he had a legendary experience of briefly contending against a King Stage with only General stage prowess, yet no one knew of his past.

As for the other…

Those unfamiliar with him were surprised by such a suddenly emerging Powerful Beast Master, while those who knew him were even more astonished than those who didn’t.

Isn’t that Boss Xu?!

Who can tell them why Boss Xu appeared at the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes, and moreover, seemed to possess considerable strength?!@@novelbin@@

For a moment, the whole spectator stand plunged into a rumble of noisy chatter, with countless humans and wild Transcendent Beings discussing fervently, holding different speculations about the upcoming battle.

In the spotlight, Xu Ran, having taken the stage and facing the Broken Jade Kite, sighed softly in his heart.

It seemed his luck wasn’t very good.

The Broken Jade Kite hadn’t chosen another arena with Fighting Attribute resources as the reward but had chosen Leaf Fighting Platform Number Three instead, making this battle inevitable.

“Hum——”

Accompanied by a deep humming sound, a light film surged up from the edges of Leaf Fighting Platform Number Three and slowly closed into a hemisphere in the sky.

Rich and brimming with life, a power that can be easily absorbed by Pet Beasts of any attribute burst forth from the leaves, blocked by the light film, without dissipating.

Inside the light film, it transformed into a sanctuary for recovery, where both injured contestants and those exhausted could quickly recuperate.

For the other leaf arenas, only after the conclusion of one battle and the emergence of the first champion would such a light film appear, but the top ten Leaf Arenas had their own little quirks.

Due to the significant strength required to reach this position, a recovery light film would appear even before the first battle started.

About a minute later, the light film slowly faded, revealing both a person and a Pet Beast inside who had returned to their peak condition, as well as the Broken Jade Kite.

“Ziyun, do you want to take this battle?” Xu Ran asked solemnly, his gaze slightly intensifying as he looked at the Broken Jade Kite, which was radiating a powerful aura in the distance.

“Meow!” (I’ll do it!)

Ziyun nodded vigorously, speaking without hesitation.

Having gained so many resources in the distribution two days ago and becoming even stronger than before, Ziyun urgently needed an opponent to test its newfound might.

And the Broken Jade Kite was just right for this.

“Crackle——”

A sharp sound of electricity burst forth, and Electric Arcs emerged from Ziyun’s body, dancing wildly in the surrounding void, making its presence suddenly become dangerous.

“Let’s do this then!”

Xu Ran shouted, unfurling the layers of cloth binding the long sword on his back, drew his sword, and pointed its tip towards the Broken Jade Kite.

This was not just a battle between Ziyun and the Broken Jade Kite.

As a Beast Master, he was also a target for the opponent and could attack as well.

“Yo——”

The Broken Jade Kite trilled softly, shifting its gaze from Ziyun for the first time, looking towards the long sword in Xu Ran’s hand, a hint of surprise glinting in its eyes.

The creature sensed a terrifying power within that long sword that could threaten its own safety, and what was more important, this power felt oddly familiar.

It seemed… that it had experienced something similar before.

What was it?

Contemplating for a moment and finding no answer, the Broken Jade Kite cast aside the thought for now and locked its teal eyes back onto Ziyun.

Although this human appeared somewhat unusual, it still considered that the most threatening entity remained the Pet Beast that seemed to be of the Thunder Attribute but indeed possessed both Thunder and Fighting attributes.

Without any warning or countdown, the battle between them erupted in an instant.

“Boom!!!”

A deep explosive roar boomed on Leaf Fighting Platform Number Three as Ziyun’s figure instantly vanished in one spot and appeared at the side of the Broken Jade Kite’s body, leaving behind a light purple path nearly hundreds of meters long in the void.

Four Star Skill, Halo Level·Path of Destruction!

Observing the Broken Jade Kite, still frozen in place as if it hadn’t yet reacted, Ziyun’s dichromatic eyes flashed ruthlessly, and in the next moment, it abruptly lifted its claws, tearing ferociously towards the Broken Jade Kite!

“Boom——”

With a violent humming sound, a claw shadow tens of meters wide, brimming with both the power of thunder and Fighting Attribute, appeared out of nowhere, plummeting towards the Broken Jade Kite. Its swift descent caused a piercing howl through the air and raised a surge of energy.

Three Star Skill, Halo Level·Destruction Thunder Claw!

In just an instant, the Broken Jade Kite’s figure was engulfed by the massive claw shadow, and the terrifying destructive power kicked up dust clouds that filled the arena.
