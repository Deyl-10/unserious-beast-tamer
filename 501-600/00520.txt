Chapter 520: Chapter 290: New Evolution Path and New Four Star Skills! (Happy New Year to Everyone!)_4

Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes!

“This time in the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes, we have one more reason to compete for third place,” Xu Ran spread his hands, his expression slightly odd.

In other competitions, it’s always about competing for first place.

But this time, the two rewards for first place were unsuitable for him and his three little companions, so aiming for third place had become the target instead.

“Xi Lu~” (Third place, it’s ours to claim!)

Ziyun readjusted his mindset and nodded firmly.

Although there was one more Main Material for Evolution than Ziyun had, a clue for one of these materials had now been found. Rounded up, it might as well be no difference at all.

“Alright, the assignments for the Evolution Paths are complete, let’s move on to Skill Fusion now,” Xu Ran smiled and tapped the chalk on the small blackboard section labeled Skill fusion stone, “We have quite a number of skill fusion stones this time.”

“Chah~” (I won’t compete this time.)

Cancan waved a paw, giving up the chance for Skill Fusion first.

Ziyun and Star were both preparing for evolution, so it was better to let them make their choices first. Cancan had not yet obtained his Evolution Path and could afford to wait.

“Meow!” (Then I’ll go first with the new skill fusion!)

Ziyun’s eyes shone, speaking up immediately.

By his calculations, the skill fusion stones this time were enough to fuse three Four Stars Skills. With so many resources, they must be put to good use!

Hearing Ziyun’s words, a glint of contemplation crossed Star’s eyes.

Currently, both he and Ziyun were in the stage of preparing for evolution. According to the team rules, both had the same priority to choose resources.

However, he was still willing to let Ziyun choose first.

After all, Ziyun’s evolution was the prerequisite for his own Evolution Ritual to be completed.

As for his evolution, it wouldn’t hurt to be a little later.

“Xi Lu~” (I’m fine with fusing just one Four Stars Skill.)

Star neighed, its eyes filled with joy and anticipation.

Seeing his teammates acquire Four Stars Skills, it would be a lie to say he wasn’t envious.

Now, at last, he also had the chance to fuse his first Four Stars Skill.

After the three little ones reached an agreement, Ziyun’s Skill Fusion began first.

“Which one are you planning to fuse?” Xu Ran selected the Skill fusion stone and asked with a smile.

“Meow~” (Heavenly Thunder Strike!)

The Three Stars Skill Heavenly Thunder Strike evolved from Ziyun’s Two stars Skill Falling Thunder, upgraded with the help of Three Stars Skill Scrolls.

And for the other three fusion skills corresponding to it, Ziyun already had some ideas in mind.

Two of them were the ranged attack Skills Puncture Thunder Spear and Thunder Penalty Gun. The last skill to select had to be compatible with a Fighting Attribute Skill to fulfill the requirements for a double-attribute Four Stars Skill evolution.

Imitating Star’s previous action, it exchanged 40 Skill Fragments for a suitable Two stars Skill. After upgrading it to Three Stars with Skill Scrolls, the fusion for Ziyun’s third Four Stars Skill began.

Five…

Ten…

Fifteen…

Amidst the repeated “Fusion failure” notifications, Xu Ran, who had already become unfazed, finally saw the colorful “Fusion success” after the 44th Skill Fusion attempt.

Looking at the skills vanishing from Ziyun’s panel and the new skill that appeared, Xu Ran’s face showed a hint of surprise.

He remembered, Ziyun’s new evolutionary form was called Astonishing Cloud Chaser.

The name of this Four Stars Skill was quite fitting for its evolutionary form…

He wondered what the effects would be like.

With that thought, Xu Ran turned his head to look at Ziyun beside him.

“Meow~”

Ziyun let out an immensely contented sound, its face full of satisfaction.

That familiar sense of becoming stronger and happier had emerged once more!

Sensing Xu Ran’s questioning gaze, it focused its attention and began to sense the brand new skill it had just mastered.

A moment later, Ziyun’s eyes revealed a deep surprise.

Its third Four Stars Skill was as strong as ever!

Whether it was Heavenly Thunder Strike, Puncture Thunder Spear, or Thunder Penalty Gun, they were all Thunder Attribute ranged attack-type skills.

Since the Fighting Attribute had almost no ranged output skills, Xu Ran and Ziyun, after some selection, had chosen a Two stars Skill that barely made the cut for ranged output: Sky Piercing Throw.

This was a throwing type of Fighting Attribute skill, which could also be considered a ranged output skill.

The system’s given fusion success rate proved that such a choice was viable.

When this skill was upgraded using Three Star Skill Scrolls, its inherent nature didn’t change much; it just became significantly more powerful.

But when it fused with the three Thunder Attribute ranged attack skills, it underwent a fundamental transformation.

Astonishing Thunder Fury was a remarkably flexible output-type skill.

It had two different modes of output.

The first method was to summon the unpredictable Thunder Of Astonishing, striking towards the designated direction.@@novelbin@@

This was an area damage skill; the closer the target was to the central area, the higher the damage received. Maximum damage with one strike could easily incapacitate opponents of the same stage, if not outright slay them.

The second method also involved summoning the Thunder Of Astonishing, but instead of directing it towards a target, it was gathered in hand to form the formidable Astonishing Thunder Spear.

This thunder spear could be used in combat, complementing Ziyun’s Immortal Body for enhanced effectiveness. It could also activate Astonishing Thunder Fury’s second form of attack.

Throwing.

By throwing the Astonishing Thunder Spear, it could instantly create a small area of high lethality Thunderbolt piercing effects, bringing about formidable single-target damage.

Compared to the first method’s area damage, the second way undoubtedly offered even higher destructive power.
