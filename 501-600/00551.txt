Chapter 551: Chapter 299: Deadwood Springs Anew, The Realm of the Semi-Saint!_2

“At this point in time, it is the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes.”

“Understood.” Xu Ran’s grip on the Broken Jade Kite loosened slightly, his face showing a look of realization.

His understanding of the Evolution Ritual came solely from the system, knowing only the outcomes and not the underlying principles. The effect that the Evolution Ritual had during the evolutionary process could only be deduced post-evolution.

Like having the answers and working backwards to understand the process.

But, other creatures in this world do not have the system.

For them to be aware of the Evolution Ritual meant they had a deeper understanding of evolution than Xu Ran, enabling them to deduce the answers without having them in hand.

And indeed, the Broken Jade Kite had not disappointed him.

Thus, Xu Ran now knew what the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood most needed to complete its evolution.

That was the recognition and veneration of the order of the Monster Wooden Domain by the beings living within and composing its order.

However…

Looking at the chaotic Monster Wooden Domain, where creatures could only shiver helplessly under the canopy of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood, Xu Ran felt a sudden weight in his heart.

In such circumstances, would they still acknowledge the order of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood?

“It’s no use.” The Broken Jade Kite seemed to sense Xu Ran’s thoughts, its voice tinged with a bit of schadenfreude, “Although this is the 47th Beast Field, once reaching the Emperor Stage, there will be…”@@novelbin@@

It suddenly paused, as if realizing it was about to reveal something forbidden and secretive, quickly skipping the topic, “In any case, the other Beast Emperors also know this.”

“Haven’t you noticed? Their first move wasn’t to attack the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood, but to attack the Monster Wooden Domain.”

“Because the Monster Wooden Domain is the foundation of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood’s evolution.”

“At this moment, with only one in ten living beings surviving, immersed in pain and despair, how could they continue to approve of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood?”

The Broken Jade Kite stopped talking and silently observed the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood, its eyes reflecting a mix of amazement and regret.

Even in the Monstrous Eight Beast Field, ambitious Beast Emperors like the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood are very rare.

The strength of the leap attribute directly determines the post-evolution strength but also decides the difficulty of the evolution.

An order, as a leap attribute, is a formidable power.

If the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood could successfully evolve and harness it, it would claim its place in the entire Eighth Beast Field.

Unfortunately…

Power, to an extent, also dictates one’s allegiances and stances.

The path the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood must take is inherently contrary to that of the Eighth Beast Field.

The involvement of the Eighth Beast Field’s shadow is likely behind the five Beast Emperors who acted today.

Therefore, its failure is almost certain.

“No, it won’t be so.” Xu Ran whispered, looking in a certain direction.

That was Monster Wooden City, now in ruins, with one particularly noticeable tall building standing out.

Under the onslaught of the Beast Emperors, it was completely undamaged, even intact.

Because that was the Starfire Foster Care Shop.

The enhancement from the system meant that mere Beast Emperors could not possibly destroy it.

“Let’s go, back to Monster Wooden City.” Without hesitation, Xu Ran patted Star’s back and commanded in a firm voice.

After the first round of ravaging, the five Beast Emperors had shifted their focus to targeting the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood itself, paying less attention to the wider area of the Monster Wooden Domain.

Monster Wooden City had become a relatively safer place.

In such a vast city, it was impossible for everyone to move under the shelter of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood in a short time; the few who managed to get there were in the minority.

The majority, who remained, were unlikely to have all perished under the Beast Emperors’ rampage.

They must be somewhere within Monster Wooden City.

Finding them and temporarily relocating them to the expanded space within the Starfire Foster would not only save their lives but could also aid in the evolution of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood to some extent.

Even if all else failed, Xu Ran could still use the shop’s transmission system to safely escape from danger.

“Xi Lu Lu~”

Star, feeling the urgency from the Beast Master, let out a cry and turned around, darting toward Monster Wooden City like a shadow.

The Broken Jade Kite, still held by Xu Ran, was dumbfounded and began to struggle fiercely.

“Human, let go of me! I won’t go!”

What a joke!

With six Beast Emperors still battling, although Monster Wooden City wasn’t at the center of the conflict, who knew if one of them might randomly strike at the city—its little life would then be over!

“Behave yourself! You are a captive now!” Xu Ran barked, his voice carrying a threat, “If the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood doesn’t evolve successfully and this crisis isn’t resolved, you will keep it company in its burial.”

This creature might still be hiding some critical information. In such desperate times, Xu Ran had to force it to cooperate.

“Madman! You’re a madman!” The Broken Jade Kite’s eyes widened, its face filled with aggrieved pain, “I’m just an onlooker! Why are you capturing me?”

“Meow!” (Quit your bitching! Don’t move!)

Ziyun raised his paw and gave the Broken Jade Kite a blow.

The Broken Jade Kite suddenly fell silent, but its eyes, filled with immense sorrow and rage, still couldn’t help looking at Xu Ran.

If glares could kill, it would have killed Xu Ran a billion times over!

With Star’s high speed, one man, three pets, and one bird swiftly entered Monster Wooden City. Xu Ran casually tossed Cancan onto the ground, “Search for the people!”
