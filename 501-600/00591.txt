Chapter 591 - 309: Du Qians Visit, A Rare Washing And Protection Subject!_4

This Double-headed Flame Crow had certain differences from a normal one.

Typically, although Double-headed Flame Crows have two distinct consciousnesses, these consciousnesses are like twin brothers, very much in sync with each other, with a tacit understanding that rarely leads to internal strife or disagreements.

But this particular Double-headed Flame Crow often experienced conflicts between its two consciousnesses, lacking the camaraderie typically seen in others of its kind.

Such anomalies could also affect Washing and Protection work.

What one consciousness liked in terms of cleaning and caring, might not be what the other preferred.

And vice versa.

Qi An still remembered when it was he himself performing the Washing and Protection on the Double-headed Flame Crow. Du Qian had exerted an enormous amount of effort, and in the end, it was only with his sister’s intervention that they successfully completed the task.

Though this incident occurred a year ago, and at that time his skills were not as polished as they are now, Du Qian still took this matter to heart.

Glancing at Xu Ran, who was about to take on the Washing and Protection work of this Double-headed Flame Crow, Du Qian hesitated for a moment, but ultimately couldn’t help speaking up, "That... The two consciousnesses of this Double-headed Flame Crow... might have some conflicts."

Xu Ran looked at Du Qian in surprise, then examined the Double-headed Flame Crow more carefully.

With Du Qian’s reminder, he quickly noticed that the two heads bathed in the firelight indeed seemed to have some hostile feelings towards each other.

Sharing one body yet not living in harmony?

Xu Ran’s expression grew more peculiar.

"So Du Xiao Ge is also here." Hearing Du Qian’s voice, the burly man realized that there was a third person in the shop.

The man was not upset upon Du Qian pointing out his Pet Beast’s issues but merely smiled, "Since Du Xiao Ge has already mentioned it, I won’t keep it hidden."

"Indeed, my Double-headed Flame Crow had a bit of an accident during its evolution, causing the two consciousnesses to lose their harmony and often enter into conflicts…"

Speaking of this, the burly man also seemed helplessly frustrated, "Often during Washing and Protection, when one consciousness feels comfortable, the other starts to act out."

"This has led to many incomplete Washing and Protection sessions, and I’m almost blacklisted by the caretakers." The big man spread his hands, "I heard you’re the new ’Cleaning Saint,’ so I decided to try my luck bringing them here."

"Understood," Xu Ran gave Du Qian a grateful look.

If it had not been for Du Qian’s reminder, this customer might not have disclosed these details.

With this knowledge, cleaning and caring for this Double-headed Flame Crow would undoubtedly be more challenging.@@novelbin@@

However... it sounded quite interesting.

"Sir, here’s the thing," Xu Ran slowly began, "Du Qian and I are engaged in an exchange on Washing and Protection. Would you mind if we use your Pet Beast as a case study for our exchange?"

"Well…" The burly man hesitated for a moment, then nodded, "Alright."

His initial failure to honestly declare his Pet Beast’s issues was his mistake after all.

But the burly man was not trying to cause trouble for Xu Ran; he was merely concerned that if he spoke up, Xu Ran might refuse to attend to his Pet Beast.

With a hint of apology in his heart, he naturally found it difficult to decline Xu Ran’s request.

Plus, since Du Qian had previous experience washing the Double-headed Flame Crow, having him there might improve the outcomes for his own Pet Beast’s washing and caring.

"Thank you for your generosity," Du Qian’s smile brightened as he nodded in acknowledgment to the man.

Undoubtedly, this rare Washing and Protection case held extremely high value for exchange.

"Follow me," Xu Ran signaled to the Double-headed Flame Crow to follow him into the Washing and Protection room after they had agreed.

"Caw—"

One of the heads of the Double-headed Flame Crow showed excitement and anticipation, quickly leaning towards Xu Ran as if eager to follow him into the Washing and Protection room.

However, the other head turned towards the outside of the Washing and Protection room, appearing somewhat reluctant and seemingly indifferent to the Washing and Protection.

Without the cooperation of its companion, the movements of the Double-headed Flame Crow became noticeably stiff and unnatural.

Seeing its companion unwilling to even cooperate with the washing and protection, the first head became instantly furious. It glared fiercely at the second head, emitting a series of sharp cries that sounded suspiciously like swearing.

The second head, not one to be easily bullied, retaliated with equally sharp cries.

Even before entering the washing and protection room, the two were already at odds again.

"Stop quarreling and go to the washing and protection room."

Ultimately, it was the heavy-set man’s stern command that made the two heads of the Double-headed Flame Crow cease their quarreling; the second head abandoned its stubbornness and obediently, in cooperation with the first, flew toward the washing and protection room.

Standing at the entrance of the washing and protection room, Xu Ran watched this unfold, suddenly feeling uncertain about the washing and protection work ahead.

This double pleasure value is going to be a tough earn...

Speaking of which, the heavy-set man spoke with a hint of helplessness, "Often during the washing and protection, one consciousness feels comfortable while the other becomes restless."

"This results in frequently interrupted washing and protection sessions; I’m almost blacklisted by those caretakers." The heavy-set man spread his hands, "I brought them here to try my luck, hearing you’re the new ’Cleaning Saint’."

"Understood." Xu Ran gave Du Qian a grateful look.

If Du Qian hadn’t given him a heads up, this customer might not have been forthcoming with this information.

Therefore, performing washing and protection work on this Double-headed Flame Crow undoubtedly will increase the difficulty substantially.

However... it seems like it could be quite interesting.

"Sir, it’s like this," Xu Ran began slowly, "Du Qian and I are in the middle of a discussion about washing and protection techniques; would you mind if your Pet Beast were to serve as a case study for our discussion?"

"This..." The heavy-set man hesitated for a moment, then nodded, "Okay."

Not being upfront about his Pet Beast’s issues was primarily his fault after all.

But the heavy-set man didn’t intend to make things difficult for Xu Ran on purpose; he just worried that revealing the issues might lead to Xu Ran refusing to perform the washing and protection on his Pet Beast.

Carrying a trace of apology in his heart, he naturally found it hard to refuse Xu Ran’s request.

Plus, Du Qian had previously conducted washing and protection on the Double-headed Flame Crow. With him present, the result of Xu Ran’s work might turn out even better.

"Thank you for your generosity," Du Qian said, his smile radiant as he nodded his thanks to the heavy-set man.

Undoubtedly, such a rare washing and protection case held immense value for academic discussion.

"Follow me," Xu Ran gestured to the Double-headed Flame Crow, signalling for it to enter the washing and protection room.

"Screech—"

One of the heads of the Double-headed Flame Crow showed an expression of excitement and anticipation, quickly reaching out in Xu Ran’s direction, as if eager to follow him into the washing and protection room.

However, the other head seemed to twist away reluctantly toward the outside of the room at that moment, appearing unwilling and seemingly indifferent to the prospect of washing and protection.

Without the cooperation of its companion, the movements of the Double-headed Flame Crow became noticeably stiff and unnatural.

Seeing its companion unwilling to even cooperate with the washing and protection, the first head became instantly furious. It glared fiercely at the second head, emitting a series of sharp cries that sounded suspiciously like swearing.

The second head, not one to be easily bullied, retaliated with equally sharp cries.

Even before entering the washing and protection room, the two were already at odds again.

"Stop quarreling and go to the washing and protection room."

Ultimately, it was the heavy-set man’s stern command that made the two heads of the Double-headed Flame Crow cease their quarreling; the second head abandoned its stubbornness and obediently, in cooperation with the first, flew toward the washing and protection room.

Standing at the entrance of the washing and protection room, Xu Ran watched this unfold, suddenly feeling uncertain about the washing and protection work ahead.
