Chapter 573 - 305 Du Huayans Letter_2

It’s alright, I’ll share my customers with you!

He wanted to see, under the same conditions of saturated client flow, who between them could get more praise from the Beast Master customers for their washing and protection skills.

"Qi An, it’s all cleaned up." The assistant nimbly finished tidying up the washing station and called out loud.

"Help me call in the next customer." Du Qi An rolled up his sleeves to the middle of his upper arms and spoke slowly.

"Huh? Okay!" The assistant was stunned for a moment, then his eyes lit up with joy, and he quickly walked out of the washing room.

Having worked with Du Qi An for a long time, the assistant was very familiar with his habits.

Normally, Du Qi An would roll his sleeves up to his elbows when washing, but sometimes, he would roll them up even further, all the way to the middle of his upper arms.

Often, this meant he was finally getting serious.

The assistant had been worried because of Du Qi An’s move to turn away customers, but now he was filled with confidence.

A serious Du Qi An was bound to take down the Cleaning Saint!

Pushing open the door of the washing room, the assistant shouted outside.

-----------------

"Next!"

Having sent off another satisfied customer, Xu Ran waved at the forming line outside, prompting the Beast Master at the very front to step forward with anticipation while the other waiting customers jostled again at the sight of the freshly groomed Pet Beast.

Initially, there were doubts about this caretaker that Du Qi An had recommended but whom they had never heard of and whose Foster Shop was utterly unfamiliar.

But as each Pet Beast came out transformed after the session, those doubts had turned into confidence and intense anticipation.

This caretaker had real skills!

At that moment, many people silently thanked Du Qi An in their hearts.

That young man, when he recommends a master, he truly means it!

"Mr. Xu, I was recommended by Du Qi An. You’ve got to give my Pet Beast a good cleaning!" Stepping inside the washing room, the new customer chuckled and initiated the conversation.

"Rest assured, I will give my best effort for each washing and protection session," Xu Ran replied with a smile, yet a flicker of peculiar light passed through his eyes.

The customer probably thought he was well-acquainted with Du Qi An, hence playing this card of sentiment.

But...

He genuinely didn’t know the caretaker named Du Qi An.

An hour ago, the appearance of a sudden queue outside his shop had also taken him by surprise.

After learning that these customers were recommended by a caretaker named Du Qi An, his feelings were rather complex.

However, Xu Ran had some clue about why Du Qi An would do this.

Knowing that Du Qi An was from the Hundred Flowers Foster Store and that he shared the Du surname, Xu Ran had a rough idea of the situation.

Previously in Monster Wooden City, the owner of Hundred Flowers Foster Store was Du Huayan, she had been invited to set up a branch there, with the main location in Bright Radiance City.

Clearly, the Hundred Flowers Foster Store where Du Qi An worked was this main branch.

Moreover, Du Huayan had once casually mentioned to him during a chat that she had a brother who was good at cleaning and caring...

If there were no surprises, this caretaker named Du Qi An was indeed Du Huayan’s brother.

So, did he learn about Xu Ran from Du Huayan and decide to help him out at this time?

Thinking about this, Xu Ran’s face couldn’t help but show a trace of wistfulness.

Just arriving in Bright Radiance City and he already owed someone a favor.

Once the cleaning exhibition was over, he would have to visit the Hundred Flowers Foster Store to express his thanks.

As his thoughts wandered, his hands didn’t slow down, and with Ziyun’s cooperation, he had already completed the preparation work for washing and protection of the waiting Pet Beast.

This customer’s Pet Beast was a Wind attribute Flying Scythe Weasel.

Despite its palm-sized Body type, it was a standout among the Leader Species of the Wind system, possessing astonishing speed and powerful attacks, capable of claiming the lives of living beings in an invisible and unpredictable manner.

However, at this moment, this ruthless Wind assassin revealed a vulnerable side under the soaking of Xu Ran’s bath liquid, its body shaking involuntarily, its face bearing a relaxed and content expression, and its eyes clouding with a misty, dazed look.

Soon, a quaint and odd sound echoed in the washing room and faintly passed through the door.

"Squeak~~~"

-----------------

"Phew~ it’s done, your Pet Beast’s cleaning and caring are finished," Liu Cang shook his slightly sore wrists, looking towards the waiting customer.

"Let me have a look." The one who had waited for quite a while quickly approached, inspecting their now radiant Pet Beast, a satisfied expression surfacing on their face, "Mr. Liu’s washing skills are just as good as before!"

"Hehe, you flatter me," Liu Cang laughed and waved his hand modestly, "It’s all part of the job."

"Anyway, I’m really thankful for Mr. Liu’s washing and protection," the customer, cradling their Pet Beast, said with joy on their face, "Do you need me to call the next customer for you?"

"Er... Thank you very much, but not for the moment," Liu Cang shook his head.

"Then I won’t disturb Mr. Liu any longer; I’ll take my leave," the customer nodded, carrying their Pet Beast out the door of the washing room.

Only when the door to the washing room closed once more did Liu Cang slump to the ground, waving his hands and revealing a helpless expression, "As one gets older, the physical condition really does decline."

"In the past, I could handle over a dozen Pet Beasts in a row with no trouble, now just a few have me needing a rest."@@novelbin@@
