Chapter 524: Chapter 292: The Battle Begins, Thousands of Clans Vie for Supremacy!

At this moment, Zhang Zhu truly felt what it meant to “want to find a crack to crawl into.”

He had naively thought that if he encountered Boss Xu in the upcoming competition, he would need to figure out how to go easy on him.

Never had he expected that Boss Xu would actually be a General Level Beast Master.

General Level!

In a Second Level Town like this, Beast Masters of this level were not particularly rare, but each one held a fairly high status.@@novelbin@@

A General Level Beast Master like Xu Ran, who runs a foster shop and daily performs washing and caring for various pet beasts, was unheard of.

“Boss Xu, you…” Zhang Zhu opened his mouth as if he were about to ask something but didn’t dare to, his expression clearly becoming a bit more tense.

“Running a foster care shop is a personal hobby of mine,” Xu Ran said with a smile, patting Zhang Zhu’s shoulder as if he saw what the latter wanted to ask. “I haven’t experienced the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes before, so I want to get familiar with it beforehand.”

“I’ll be watching today’s competition closely, so you’ll need to work hard,” he said, giving Zhang Zhu a supportive hand gesture, “After all, you are a guest of our Starfire Foster Care Shop.”

“Yes, yes!” Zhang Zhu nodded vigorously, his eyes filled with renewed fighting spirit.

Boss Xu had such a high opinion of him; he felt he needed to perform even better.

In that instant, a thought swiftly emerged in Zhang Zhu’s mind.

If he managed to achieve a good ranking in today’s Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes, he would definitely find a way to let more people know about the Starfire Foster Care Shop!

As the two conversed, the team moved quickly. In a short while, Xu Ran could see the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood, which seemed to grow larger as it got closer.

Compared to the last sighting of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood, it seemed to have grown even bigger now, clearly, its trend of expanding outward showing no signs of abating.

On one side of the massive body of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood, Xu Ran also saw from afar the competition site for this Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes.

It was a Sky-reaching Pillar, specifically constructed from the body of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood for the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes, about a hundred meters thick.

On the side of this Sky-reaching Pillar, from bottom to top, were spiral platforms each spanning several hundred meters. Each platform was supported by an incredibly large leaf, and at the center of each leaf platform, there surged rich energy fluctuations.

Those were the leaf rewards hidden within the platforms.

Seeing this, a look of awe couldn’t help but appear on Xu Ran’s face.

It had to be said, although its colossal size brought great troubles to the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood, such a massive body indeed produced a stunning impact under certain conditions.

Just like at this moment, the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood simply extended a single branch and easily constructed such a vast competition arena.

Zhang Zhu, standing nearby, apparently already had his sight set on a platform to compete for. His gaze was firmly fixated on a particular leaf, his fighting intent growing even stronger.

A moment later, he withdrew his gaze, noticing Xu Ran’s expression. Knowing it was his first time seeing the Battle of Ten Thousand Races, he began to explain proactively, “The Sky-reaching Pillar and leaf platforms will continue to expand over the next three days.”

“The current size of the leaf platforms is only three hundred meters in diameter, which is designed for battles in the Elite Stage.”

“Tomorrow, for the Leadership Stage, the size of the leaf platforms will expand to one kilometer. The day after, in the General Level, it will be three kilometers, and on the last day, at the King Stage, it will be ten kilometers…” As he spoke, Zhang Zhu’s face couldn’t help but show a bit of wistfulness.

“I saw the conditions of the last day of the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes last year. It was truly magnificent, as with the expansion of the fighting platforms, the Sky-reaching Pillar will grow thicker and taller, even surpassing the size of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood itself.”

“I can roughly imagine that,” Xu Ran inhaled sharply, his expression of awe growing even deeper.

Each leaf platform with a scale of ten kilometers, over a hundred such leaves spiraling to the clouds, such a battle arena was utterly astonishing.

And the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood that shaped such an arena was incredibly powerful.

One could assume it to be among the virtually invincible at the Beast Emperor level, right?

But…

A tinge of worry inevitably emerged in Xu Ran’s eyes.

Supporting its own body was already a massive burden for the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood at present, necessitating long periods of slumber to alleviate this pressure.

In such a situation, it was still committing to constructing a colossal arena not inferior to its own size to host the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes.

Could there really be no problem?

Looking at Zhang Zhu’s face, full of excitement and eagerness, who had never considered this point, Xu Ran sighed softly in his heart.

Perhaps he was being over-concerned.

“Boss Xu, I need to go check in at the Waiting area for the Battle of Ten Thousand Races,” Zhang Zhu pointed towards the venue not far away, at two tall Gigantic Spirit Ostriches wearing special floral crowns on their heads.

By their side, a medley of Transcendent Beings and Humans were already gathered.

Obviously, these two Giant Spirit Ostriches, known for their intelligence, were de facto staff members responsible for check-in today.

“Alright, go ahead, do your best!” Xu Ran smiled and sent his well wishes again, watching as Zhang Zhu departed and then turning his gaze back to his three little ones, “The first Battle of Ten Thousand Races hasn’t started yet; shall we take a walk around?”

Upon entering the competition venue, he had already seen many lively stands.

Yes, stands.

Just like the stands in the Monster Wooden Marketplace, during this grand event in the Monster Wooden Domain, many shrewd individuals had also brought valuable items from their tribes to set up shops.
