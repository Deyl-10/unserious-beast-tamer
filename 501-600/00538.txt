Chapter 538: Chapter 296: You’re Telling Me This Is a Little Turtle?!

“It’s gone.”

Watching the Broken Jade Kite disappear into the horizon, Xu Ran let out a slight sigh of relief.

Setting aside the three little ones who had grown up with him, who seemed to have their settings turned up, the strength of this Broken Jade Kite was extremely rare at the General stage level.

At that last moment, Xu Ran could vaguely guess that the opponent’s skill must have been some critical skill that, if allowed to be executed successfully, might not even be easily countered by Ziyun.

Alas, the opponent’s skill was precisely restrained by Ziyun’s Thunder Shake Heavenly Sound; it was over before it even began.@@novelbin@@

If the one facing off hadn’t been Ziyun, but Cancan, then that Broken Jade Kite…

Oh, Cancan has the Land of Destruction.

It seems then that the Broken Jade Kite could only have defeated Star.

Star: “???”

“Meow~” (I’ve almost recovered!)

Ziyun, on the side, was already back at full health.

In this arena shrouded by a light film, the energy was unimaginably dense, and after special modifications by the Beast Emperor, it was very easy to absorb.

Add to that the Fated Star Pulling skill Star had executed as soon as it appeared.

Ziyun, who had not been injured, only exhausted, recovered very quickly.

“Stay sharp,” Xu Ran’s voice paused slightly, “This light film should be fading soon, and our rest time between defenses is about to end.”

“Soon, other strong opponents will come on stage, and we must not underestimate them.”

“Meow!” (Understood!)

Ziyun responded and quickly adopted a ready-to-fight posture.

“Not so fast.” Seeing Ziyun looking so, Xu Ran smiled, “You won’t be needed in every fight; we have to give Star and Cancan a chance to perform too.”

“Indeed!” (Exactly, exactly!)

Cancan nodded vigorously, with a look of complete agreement in its eyes.

After all, it was the second powerhouse and the top defender in the team – how could it merely watch its companions show off in such a situation?

It had Four-Star skills too!

Even Star let out a neigh, nodding in agreement.

Although it didn’t really have any offensive methods of its own.

But the rules of the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes stated that a Beast Master must fight in tandem with one Pet Beast, which changed the equation.

The Fated Star Pulling was about to showcase its splendor once again!

And…

It also wanted to try out the effects of its newly fused Four-Star skill, Prayer of Starry Night!

“Meow~” (Alright, alright~)

Seeing its two companions brimming with the zeal of battle, Ziyun shook its paw in resignation and stepped back.

It looked like Ziyun’s dream of dominating the arena from start to finish was doomed to remain unfulfilled.

“In a while, I will choose one of you three based on the strength of our opponents,” Xu Ran said with a smile, pointing to the platforms on the Sky-reaching Pillar meant for climbing and resting, “Those who aren’t chosen, wait on the platforms outside the arena.”

All three little ones nodded, signifying they understood.

As the trio of one human and three beasts communicated, the light film enveloping the entire arena slowly dissipated.

The outside scene became visible.

Although Xu Ran’s fight with the Broken Jade Kite had not taken much time, there were quite a few strong and fast contenders among the rest.

On the upper Leaf Arenas number one and two, and the other top ten below, fierce battles had already begun in succession, and outside the third arena where Xu Ran was, several figures with fighting spirits high in the sky had appeared.

As the light film completely vanished, the third arena was once again open for challenge, and these figures looked at each other as if pondering who should make the first move.

They seemed to have reached a tacit agreement in silence.

A Transcendent Being that looked like a specter, shrouded in black mist, floated onto the stage, and then a slit opened in its round belly, from which a fierce-looking man emerged.

Xu Ran’s gaze slightly intensified.

It was Zhao Tuo, previously mentioned, the Beast Master known as Tuoba Hai!

It was unexpected that after the battle with the Broken Jade Kite, Xu Ran would face off against Tuoba Hai so soon.

Compared to wild Transcendent Beings, he was more accustomed to human Beast Masters and knew full well that the power of a strong Beast Master, combined with their Pet Beasts, was no simple sum.

This opponent in front of him should not be underestimated.

While Xu Ran examined his adversary, Tuoba Hai, who had come onto the stage, was also sizing up Xu Ran.

Those hawk-like eyes held strong desire for combat and curiosity.

Since when did Monster Wooden Domain have such a formidable General Stage Beast Master?

Originally, when he saw that Xu Ran was using a Thunder Attribute Pet Beast, he thought he might not encounter Xu Ran, but fate had made their paths cross regardless.

But… that was precisely what he wanted!

A frenzy appeared in Tuoba Hai’s eyes.

He was a pure warmonger.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been born in the peaceful Monster Wooden City but yearned for the chaos of other Beast Fields.

For Tuoba Hai, encountering an opponent with similar strength and battling against them was a great joy.

Therefore, he never missed the annual Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes, which he had attended many times.

Because the speed of his own Pet Beast was very fast, he had watched the second half of Xu Ran’s fight with the Broken Jade Kite.

Tuoba Hai had also kept an eye on the Broken Jade Kite and even thought about facing them in the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes, but now, it seemed unlikely.

The explosive skill of Xu Ran’s overpowered Pet Beast ignited a fire in him.
