Chapter 521: 291: The First Four-Star Skill Of The Star!

Chapter 521: Chapter 291: The First Four-Star Skill of the Star!

For characters with fragile builds who rely on DPS, aside from explosive output, another very important element is, of course, elusive speed that makes it difficult for opponents to catch.

Ziyun was keenly aware that she was not skilled in terms of defense, unable to be without flaws like Cancan, so she needed to find a different approach, to perform even better in the realm of speed.

The fourth Four Star Skill she chose to enhance was Step on Electric Traces.

This skill, which had been upgraded from the initial Electric Arc, had accompanied Ziyun throughout her entire growth and strengthening journey.

Now, it was time to elevate it to the highest star level it could currently achieve.

One of the evolution conditions for Ziyun required at least four Four Star Skills that were dual-type, Thunder Attribute and Fighting Attribute. With the successful fusion of Divine Punishment and Astonishing Thunder Fury, half of this goal had already been met.

The remaining two Four Star dual-type skills included one that was already a dual-type skill, Destruction Thunder Claw.

As for the last dual-type skill, Ziyun planned to choose between King’s Power and Thunder Shake Heavenly Sound, while Step on Electric Traces would remain as its original trait, upgrading to Four Star as a pure Thunder Attribute skill.

The three skills that were to be fused with Step on Electric Traces had already been gradually gathered by Ziyun, through absorption of resources from the King Stage tier and the enhancement from Three Star Skill Scrolls.

What was needed were just a sufficient quantity of skill fusion stones.

“Meow!” (Let’s begin!)

With eyes filled with anticipation, Ziyun turned to Xu Ran and urged him.

“Alright,” Xu Ran nodded slightly, then once again opened the Skill Fusion interface and selected Step on Electric Traces along with the other three skills that Ziyun had prepared.

Fusion… began!

After numerous attempts signifying fusion failure with a purple-grey light, that one distinct flash of color was unmistakably clear. After 42 failures, Step on Electric Traces slowly vanished from Ziyun’s panel.@@novelbin@@

In its place was a brand new Four Star Skill.

“Meow~~~”

Ziyun trembled uncontrollably, the instinctual joy of life transformation from when Astonishing Thunder Fury was upgraded to Four Star had not completely subsided, and now a new Four Star Skill brought waves of tremendous pleasure.

Its eyes slightly squinted, making strange noises uncontrollably from its throat. It took quite a while this time to gradually calm down.

Realizing Xu Ran’s and the other two’s gazes, a sense of embarrassment instantly welled up in Ziyun’s heart.

“Meow… Meow!” (It’s an instinctive reaction!)

Ziyun couldn’t help but argue, then looked at Cancan.

Cancan had also experienced the upgrade to Four Star skill and should understand, right?

“Chirp~” (I understand.)

Cancan nodded affirmatively, showing understanding.

The peculiar feeling that came with the upgrade from Three Star to Four Star, Cancan hadn’t forgotten it even now.

That must be the happiness of growing stronger.

As Xu Ran watched the interaction between Ziyun and Cancan and heard Star’s snort mixed with anticipation and impatience, he couldn’t help but smile.

Following the completion of Ziyun’s second Skill Fusion, it was now Star’s turn for Skill Fusion.

Different from the other two, it would be Star’s first time experiencing such an event.

Although it had previously experienced its Talent Skill upgrading from Two Stars to Three Stars, upgrading from Three Stars to Four Stars was clearly a whole different matter.

So, what exactly does that feel like? So anxious…

“What is the effect of your new skill like?” asked Xu Ran, still smiling, as he looked over at the interactions among the three creatures.

“Meow…” (The new skill, you ask…)

Reminded by Xu Ran, Ziyun quickly refocused on the matter at hand.

Experiencing the myriad of skill usage scenarios and memories that suddenly surfaced in her mind, the light in her heterochromatic eyes began to shine brilliantly.

This skill…

Fit her situation so incredibly well!

Having fully grasped the entire skill, Ziyun couldn’t resist immediately sharing the details of this skill with Xu Ran and the other two.

As they had initially anticipated, the fused new skill was a pure Thunder Attribute skill, and compared to the original Step on Electric Traces, it was a qualitative change.

The original Step on Electric Traces allowed Ziyun to not only move at extremely high speeds but also to leave behind shadows of accumulated Thunderforce along her movement path.

These shadows could linger for a while and, if touched by an enemy in mid-course, would automatically explode, causing a small area of Thunder Attribute blast damage.

During the lifespan of the shadows, Ziyun could at any time return to any one of the shadows’ positions.

While this skill could also inflict damage, its primary function was still to enhance speed.

Path of Destruction was a skill that equally emphasized both speed and damage.

It retained Ziyun’s speed from Step on Electric Traces and greatly enhanced it, eradicating the production of shadows and the effect of returning to them.

In their place, a brand new effect was introduced.

Lei Jing.

After deploying Path of Destruction, Ziyun’s trajectory would solidify into Lei Jing, and any enemies touching the Lei Jing would suffer Thunder Strike damage and a strong paralyzing effect.

Ziyun herself and the Lei Jing were one and the same; she could appear at any spot on the Lei Jing without any restrictions.

It covered all the effects of the original Step on Electric Traces, and even added the one key element Ziyun had been lacking.
