Chapter 519: Chapter 290: New Evolution Path and New Four Star Skills! (Happy New Year to Everyone!)_3

At this moment, it felt rather like having plenty of debt was not so burdensome after all.

“Xi Lu~” (No need!)

Star suddenly shook its head, its eyes flickering with contemplative expression.

Ziyun had once unleashed Divine Punishment, and Star had witnessed the agonizing backlash. If possible, it naturally did not wish for Ziyun to suffer such pain on its behalf again.

Moreover, it indeed wasn’t necessary.

It could enhance Ziyun, causing Ziyun’s strength to increase substantially without needing to rely on Divine Punishment.

Of course, even with its own enhancements, the prospect of Ziyun killing a King Stage Transcendent Being was still remote.

But!@@novelbin@@

If the one it enhanced was Ziyun after evolving to the General stage · Emperor Species, then?

Then presumably, it could easily kill a King Stage being without needing Divine Punishment, right?

When Star articulated its thoughts clearly, there was also a spark of realization in Ziyun’s eyes.

Right! That’s another way to do it!

Being able to use Divine Punishment one less time, it naturally had no objections.

“Meow~” (Then it’s decided!)

Let it first complete its evolution, then help Star kill a Dark King Level!

“It seems this problem is solved,” Xu Ran smiled, “Now, let’s discuss Star’s evolution conditions.”

“Aside from all the Talent Skills being upgraded to Four Stars, reaching the Violent Sun Level, Star also needs to have at least three skills related to Star Power,” Xu Ran said, looking towards Star, “Do you know what this means?”

A contemplative expression appeared on Star’s face, and shortly after, as though it had realized something, its eyes brightened.

“Xi Lu…” (I think I know what it means…)

It possessed a Three Star Skill called Star Falling Power yet to be fused with other skills, originating from a King Stage resource it had absorbed earlier.

This resource permitted it to absorb the power of outer stars to recover and bolster itself.

Because of the existence of this skill, Star had long been exposed to so-called Star Power and was clear about which of its skills were related to Star Power.

The first one, Fated Star Pulling.

This skill, in Star’s initial form upon awakening, was a Two Star Skill called Star Chain.

It was the only skill that had a connection to Star Power back then.

Later, with the aid of a Three Star Skill Scroll, it transformed into the current Fated Star Pulling, and its connection to Star Power didn’t fade but became even clearer.

Without a doubt, it counted as a skill related to Star Power.

As long as it was upgraded to Four Stars, one third of the additional evolution conditions would be fulfilled.

Apart from that, Star had another skill connected to Star Power.

That was the new skill awakened alongside its last evolution, after it developed a shiny horn on its forehead, the Two Star Skill Immortal Star Attraction.

Now, it had likewise been elevated to a Three Star Skill called Star Refusal Ring.

Simply by upgrading this skill further to a Four Star Skill, another third of the additional evolution conditions could be satisfied.

As for the final third…

That would fall upon Star Falling Power.

In Star’s plans, Star Falling Power would be fused with Heart of Eternal Night, and it was going to be the first skill to undergo fusion.

After completing the fusion, the newly developed skill would also be related to Star Power.

So…

Though the evolution condition was complex, it seemed it could be effortlessly achieved.

After sharing its analysis with Xu Ran, Xu Ran also breathed a sigh of relief.

“Since there’s no issue with evolution conditions, now there’s only one last problem,” Xu Ran paused slightly, “Evolution materials.”

“Regarding that, I have a piece of good news and a piece of bad news. Which would you like to hear first?” Xu Ran glanced at Star, suddenly speaking with a cheery tone.

“Xi Lu~” (Let’s hear the bad news first.)

Star neighed in response, its expression turning solemn.

It was ready for the likelihood that its evolution resources would be difficult to find.

“The bad news is, you have one more main material to gather for your evolution than Ziyun does,” Xu Ran spread his hands.

“Xi Lu~” (One more, huh…)

A trace of resignation appeared in Star’s eyes.

It was common knowledge how hard to find Ziyun’s evolution resources were.

If not for good fortune, the Extreme Source Vein Crystal, which only appeared during the Battle of Ten Thousand Tribes in Monster Wooden City, might have taken a longer time to find.

The Extinct Thunder Attraction, a powerful resource that even Overlord stage Transcendent Beings regretted missing before their fall, was now known to have a specific whereabouts, but was being guarded by two Thunder Attribute King Stage Transcendent Beings, and there was still a wait for its day of birth.

Even the Thunder Attribute Emperor Stage Blood Essence, exchangeable since their time in Xieyun City, demanded a hefty amount of Beast Master Points at a sky-high price.

Whereas the last two evolution materials, Brilliant Gem and Eternal Life Calamity Dew, could be more simply acquired, and clearly, although they were also main materials, their importance was nowhere near the former three.

And now, the number of main materials needed for its evolution even surpassed Ziyun’s.

So when would it be able to gather all these resources, not until the proverbial ‘monkeys grow horns’?

“Cancan?” (What’s the good news, then?)

Before Star could regain its composure, Cancan, who was right beside, asked out of curiosity.

“The good news…” Xu Ran chuckled, “One of the materials is the Star Scar Night Light Stone.”

Star Scar Night Light Stone…

Mulling over the name of this material, Star suddenly felt a flicker of familiarity.

Once it realized where this familiarity came from, its amethyst-like eyes fiercely ignited with a desire for battle.
