Chapter 565: Chapter 302: Semi-Saint’s Gift! New Beginnings and Farewells!_4

“No wonder he dared to run over from the Monster Wooden Domain alone…” the Beast Master uttered, then suddenly smacked his own head with annoyance, “I forgot to ask him what the situation is like over there now.”

“This is a major event affecting the entire number 47 Beast Field, and I happened to meet someone involved, yet I actually forgot to ask!”

—————–

“Mr. Xu, your migration procedures have been completed, and the points and deposits on your Beast Master account can be used within Bright Radiance City,” the staff member said with a polite smile. “Besides that, there’s one more thing.”

“Vice-President Liu from our Bright Radiance City would like to have a few words with you.”

“Vice-President Liu?” Taking the procedure certificate from the staff member, Xu Ran showed a puzzled expression on his face, “It’s my first time in Bright Radiance City, I shouldn’t be acquainted with this Vice-President Liu, should I?”@@novelbin@@

“Indeed, you don’t, but you come from Monster Wooden City, and yesterday in Monster Wooden City…” The staff member did not continue but gave Xu Ran a “you know what I mean” look.

Xu Ran understood.

Was the other party curious and wanting to contact him to find out about the situation in the Monster Wooden Domain?

“No problem,” Xu Ran smiled.

Just arriving in a new city, one must build good relationships with the bigwigs of the Beast Master Association.

This way, his own branch shops might receive some conveniences.

Of course, he would only talk as an observer about things he could actually discuss.

Soon, under the guidance of this staff member, Xu Ran met that Vice-President Liu.

The man was burly and seemed to have an air of a jianghu bandit about him.

As the staff member introduced, Vice-President Liu’s full name was Liu Kuang. His contract power had reached the Sixth Stage, but it was a pity that he had not managed to evolve a Pet Beast into the Emperor Species.

Therefore, he had contracted six King Stage Pet Beasts, making him stronger than a King Level Beast Master but not as much as an Overlord Level Beast Master. He ranked third in power in Bright Radiance City.

The top two were Overlord Level Beast Masters.

Upon meeting Xu Ran, Liu Kuang did not put on airs as the Vice-President or a high-ranking senior. He started chatting casually with Xu Ran, which made Xu Ran feel more fondness for this Beast Master.

Sure enough, he told Liu Kuang everything he could.

“Tsk, tsk, tsk, it’s just a pity I couldn’t witness it with my own eyes.” Liu Kuang’s face showed a bit of longing, “To see the evolution process of an Emperor Species into a Saint Spirit Race with one’s own eyes would already be an incredible opportunity.”

“So, young brother Xu, why didn’t you just stay peacefully in the Monster Wooden Domain and instead run off to our Bright Radiance City?” Liu Kuang lifted his big hand and patted Xu Ran’s shoulder.

“With the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood becoming a Demon Wood Semi-Saint, it will surely look after the creatures of the Monster Wooden Domain more. I think your strength is not weak, and you are so young, you should seize that opportunity.”

“Well…” Xu Ran smiled, “Actually, my main job is running a foster shop.”

“Oh, running a foster shop, huh… Wait, what?!” Liu Kuang’s eyes bulged, “You? A foster shop owner?”

Xu Ran looked to be under thirty, yet he was already a General Stage Beast Master, and the strength of his three Pet Beasts seemed quite formidable. Such potential in their Bright Radiance City could already crush countless peer Beast Masters.

And you’re telling me you are a businessman running a foster shop?

“Yes, that’s right,” Xu Ran puffed out his chest and sat up straight, “My foster care shop is called Starfire Foster, and I have already opened branches in three cities. I have come to Bright Radiance City this time to open the fourth branch here…”

“Hold on a minute… My brain’s a bit muddled…” Liu Kuang rubbed his forehead.

Opening a branch…

You really are a businessman, aren’t you?

To leave behind such talent and opportunity and come all the way to Bright Radiance City just to open another branch – should I admire your dedication or think you’re being reckless?

“Forget it.” Liu Kuang shook his head, “Here in Bright Radiance City, the competition in the foster industry is pretty fierce. Have you picked a good location for your shop, young brother Xu?”

As he asked the question, Liu Kuang glanced at Xu Ran’s expression and his lips twitched slightly, “It seems not.”

“Could you recommend one to me, elder brother Liu?” Xu Ran took the opportunity to climb up the social ladder, showing a warm smile.
