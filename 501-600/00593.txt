Chapter 593 - 310 First Exploration_2

Du Qian: "???"

Zhou Zhu: "???"

"Just kidding," Xu Ran chuckled, "the second consciousness of the Double-headed Flame Crow naturally opposes the first, but it has none of the memories of that forced Red Fire Crow."

"Essentially, for the Double-headed Flame Crow, it’s just a second self with a rebellious attitude."

"To make the underlying subconscious of the other side disappear, the first thing to do is to increase its sense of identity with the first consciousness."

"The one that disliked being washed and protected began to enjoy it under my care, just like the first consciousness, and this is how I covertly dissolved its inner defenses."

"Then comes the task of using washing and protection techniques to reorganize the Double-headed Flame Crow’s internal power."

-----------------

The Beast Master of the Double-headed Flame Crow was named Zhou Zhu.

He was well aware of his Pet Beast’s condition.

As a Transcendent Being with two independent consciousnesses, the evolution of the Double-headed Flame Crow was also somewhat different from other Transcendent Beings.

Its initial species was the Red Fire Crow, and to evolve from a Red Fire Crow into a Double-headed Flame Crow, it required the assistance of another Red Fire Crow.

After the completion of the evolution, the assisting Red Fire Crow would permanently lose a portion of its power, because part of its spirit would transform into the second consciousness of the Double-headed Flame Crow during evolution.

Furthermore, the assisting Red Fire Crow would lose the potential to evolve into a Double-headed Flame Crow.

No creature willingly makes sacrifices for another, so Zhou Zhu, intent on evolving his Red Fire Crow, had no choice but to capture a wild Red Fire Crow and force it to cooperate in the evolution.

The evolution was successful but also a failure.

His Red Fire Crow had transformed into a King Species, the Double-headed Flame Crow, but the newly born consciousness was too independent and seemed to solidify the wild Red Fire Crow’s grievances, instinctively enjoying opposing the original consciousness.

Their power was disjointed and stiff due to the discordance between the two consciousnesses, visible from the Double-headed Flame Crow’s flames, which were dark and speckled with impurities.

Originally, after repeated failed attempts and fruitless visits to powerful individuals for help, Zhou Zhu had given up on improving the Double-headed Flame Crow’s condition.

But now, as the flames around the Double-headed Flame Crow gradually became pure and bright, and the impurities rapidly diminished, Zhou Zhu’s eyes reignited with the flame of hope.

This calm and robust man couldn’t control his emotions and hurried to the washing and protection platform. He propped himself up on the platform with both hands and stared fixedly at the Double-headed Flame Crow close at hand, then he spoke in a hesitant voice.

"Boss Xu... can you resolve my Pet Beast’s problem?"

"Let’s try," Xu Ran did not make a firm promise but simply smiled mysteriously, his kneading motions continuing uninterrupted.

His powerful hands left indentations on the Double-headed Flame Crow’s body, sliding over its muscles and bones with the aid of bath oil, and each point of kneading fully stimulated the flame power within the Double-headed Flame Crow’s body.

Once, twice, three times...

The cries of the Double-headed Flame Crow became clearer and more piercing, its flames growing more intense and vigorous.

Finally, Xu Ran released his hands and stepped back a few paces.

As flames soared into the sky, the Double-headed Flame Crow flapped its wings and hovered in mid-air.

Its aura was now clearly different from before; the fiery light around it was pure and bright, and there was no longer any disharmony between its two heads.

"This..." Du Qi An watched the entire process in shock, completely bewildered.

Washing and protection, in his mind, were supposed to be services for maintaining a Pet Beast’s condition.

How had it become such an easy fix for the Double-headed Flame Crow’s consciousness conflict issues when it came to Xu Ran?

Before he could voice his question, Zhou Zhu couldn’t help but speak up.

"Boss Xu, how exactly did you do it?" His eyes were full of excitement, "During these years after the evolution of the Double-headed Flame Crow, I visited many evolution researchers and powerful Beast Masters."

"They all said they couldn’t help with the Double-headed Flame Crow’s issues."

"But you resolved it so easily."@@novelbin@@

"Well..." Xu Ran smiled, "Because this problem was actually easy to resolve."

"If I’m not mistaken, during the evolution of the Double-headed Flame Crow, you must have forced another Red Fire Crow to cooperate, right?"

"Yes... that’s right." Zhou Zhu looked a bit awkward but nodded, "I really couldn’t find any Red Fire Crow willing to cooperate voluntarily, so I had no choice but to resort to that."

"To evolve a Red Fire Crow into a Double-headed Flame Crow, it needs to consume part of the spirit of another of its kind. The closer the strength of the other is to the Red Fire Crow itself, the easier the evolution," Xu Ran spoke calmly, "but there’s something that needs attention here."

"And that is, the spirit contains the emotions and obsessions of the original Red Fire Crow."

"If the other of its kind is willing to cooperate, it can minimize its own impact, and the second consciousness that evolves out of the first is although independent, yet its likes and personality are similar, resulting in a natural harmony."

"But if the other of its kind is unwilling..." Xu Ran paused, "its emotions and obsessions will be more profoundly embedded in the spirit taken away, thereby affecting the newly born second consciousness."

"You forced another Red Fire Crow to cooperate with your Red Fire Crow’s evolution; the emotions were surely resistant. That slight emotion at the time merged into the spirit swallowed by your Red Fire Crow, shaping the new consciousness."
