Chapter 558  - 301: The Secret of the Saint Spirit, Xuanmu's Gift!

Starfire Foster Care Shop, Foster area.

The spacious foster area was somewhat crowded. Inside the foster area, countless creatures had their eyes tightly shut, adopting postures of respect and reverence that were characteristic of their own species, continuing their devoted prayers for the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood.

Until a certain moment, a familiar thought appeared in their minds.

"Thank you for your hard work. I have received your blessings. You may stop now."

The calm and gentle thought made numerous creatures in the area open their eyes in surprise.

If the Beast Emperor Sky-reaching Xuanmu was in such a stable state, did that mean...

The next words from the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood confirmed the creatures' speculations.

"Come out, everyone. To witness the birth process of the Holy Spirit Race can also be considered a fine opportunity."

"Let's go!" Xu Ran's eyes showed an excited expression as he shouted, "Everyone, please keep order. Do not crowd, and leave here in a queue!"

The three staff members understood and immediately took on the role of maintaining order, directing the crowded and restless creatures in the foster area to leave in an orderly fashion.

It took a while before everyone had left the Starfire Foster Care Shop and stood within the ruins of what had been Monster Wooden City.

Through the collapsed walls and tall buildings, every creature could see the state of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood at this moment.

Its body was much larger than before, almost covering half of the Monster Wooden Domain. The falling dead leaves covered the scarred Monster Wooden Domain, and the dried, blackened branches faintly bore the remnants of prior madness and indescribable chaos.

The Sky-touching Mysterious Wood at this moment looked like a giant tree that had withered and died.

Yet within its silent body, all creatures could feel an immense, indescribable power, a presence that made them unconsciously want to prostrate in worship, gestating rapidly.

"Crack~"

A crystal-clear sound echoed from the remnants of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood, like the first cry of a newborn, resonating with an enchanting magic.

All creatures, as if by some prearranged signal, turned their gazes to a spot amidst the expansive, withered branches of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood.

There, on the decrepit limb, the first crack appeared, revealing a dazzling aqua-gold light beneath.

"Crack~ Crack~"

More sounds of splintering followed.

After the first, they arose one after another until they merged into a chorus.

More and more cracks appeared all over the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood, spreading from the tips of the branches to its main trunk.

Streams of aqua-gold light shone out from the cracks, overlapping and intersecting, casting bright pathways of light into the void.

Eventually, when the number of these fissures peaked, the body of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood shuddered violently. @@novelbin@@

"Whooosh—"

Accompanied by the sound of collapsing tiles, the withered outer layer that clung to the tree's body completely peeled away onto the ground, revealing a new being of aqua-gold before everyone's eyes.

It was a towering tree with aqua-gold patterns from its trunk to its branches. Each branch unfurled as though it could shatter the sky, with each slight movement carrying the weight capable of crushing the void itself.

A force, surpassing the level of Beast Emperor, burst forth from around it, sharp and domineering like a spear piercing the heavens, instantly clearing clouds for hundreds of miles, revealing a washed clear sky.

The next moment, the aqua-gold light around the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood grew increasingly blinding.

Converging in the sky, the enigmatic power and novel Attribute contained within rapidly altered the surrounding space and the forces that previously existed there.

In the end, mysterious patterns wove together behind the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood, one end connected to it and the other rooted in the surrounding void, forming a magnificent Wheel of Life.

Xu Ran's breath caught at this moment.

Five Stars Skills, Saint Spirit Wheel of Life!

This was the second time he witnessed this symbol unique to the Holy Spirit Race.

But compared to the last time, the shock this brought was undoubtedly more profound.

Because the inscrutable power of the Holy Spirit Race could not be recorded or replicated, Xu Ran had only seen its external manifestations when watching the recording last time.

But this time, Xu Ran not only saw clearly the posture of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood stepping into the Holy Spirit Race but also distinctly felt, on the Saint Spirit Wheel of Life above, that overwhelmingly powerful, transcendent presence unique to the Holy Spirit Race, beyond the ten Attributes.

Leap Attribute, Order!

At this moment, all creatures could not help but cheer.

Witnessing the unique power that only the legendary Holy Spirit Race could wield, they knew that the evolution of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood had succeeded.

Beast Domain No. 47 had its first member of the Holy Spirit Race!

The next moment, their cheers turned to gasps of awe.

For the pose of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood changed once again.

Under the gaze of all creatures, its body, which spanned half of the Monster Wooden Domain, began to contract for the first time.

Like a retracted spear returning to the hand, the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood halted its expansion that hadn't ceased for hundreds of years. It rapidly retracted all its branches back into its body and, accompanied by a hazy aqua-gold light, its trunk also visibly shrank before their very eyes.

"Boom, boom, boom~"

With each deep roar, the land of the entire Monster Wooden Domain trembled violently, as if a dragon were turning over beneath it.

All creatures could clearly feel the ground beneath their feet sinking slowly, as if a layer had been suddenly extracted from the earth below.
