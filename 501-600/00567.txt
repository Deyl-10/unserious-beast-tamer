Chapter 567: Chapter 303: Pet Beast Cleaning and Caring Exhibition?_2

“`

So, the top priority is to raise the fame of Starfire Foster Care Shop!

“Ms. Zhang, could you elaborate?”

“No problem.” Zhang Li smiled, “Washing and Protection isn’t just about improving appearances, it’s also an important way to maintain a Pet Beast’s state and physical functions, so the Beast Master Association of Bright Radiance City encourages the emergence of more talent in the Washing and Protection field.”

“The Pet Beast Cleaning and Caring Exhibition is an event created for this purpose.”

“Caretakers skilled in cleaning and caring for Pet Beasts can register to participate, and during the two-day exhibition, they will attend to the Pet Beasts that come for Washing and Protection.”

“At the end of the exhibition, the Association will award a ‘Cleaning Saint’ title and a prize based on the positive feedback received from the Washing and Protection of the Pet Beasts.”

“The Pet Beast Cleaning and Caring Exhibition is held once every three years, and the next one will take place in three days. You can register at any time before it starts.” Zhang Li smiled at Xu Ran, “Mr. Xu, your timing couldn’t be better.”

“If you can get the title of ‘Cleaning Saint’, you might be worthy of my Dawn Building No.1.” Zhao Heyear folded his arms and spoke emotionlessly.

From his eyes, it was clear he held no hope for this.

“Is that so…” Xu Ran smiled, “Then I might as well give it a try.”

After listening to Zhang Li’s introduction to the Pet Beast Cleaning and Caring Exhibition, he was determined.

He simply had to participate in this event.

“Mr. Zhao, I’ve imposed on you long enough today, I’ll take my leave now.” Xu Ran stood up, bowed to Zhao Heyear, and turned to leave Dawn Building No.1.

Zhang Li followed him out, smiling, “Mr. Xu, would you like me to show you some other shops for sale?”

“Sure.”

Xu Ran didn’t refuse and followed Zhang Li to look at other available shops.

But having seen the finest with Dawn Building No.1, all other shops seemed to lack that certain something for Xu Ran.

After looking around, not only had Xu Ran not given up, but he wanted Dawn Building No.1 even more.

If he could get the title of “Cleaning Saint” at the exhibition and have the advantage of the shop’s location, he could become a hands-off shopkeeper in no more than a week.

Do you understand the value of being a hands-off shopkeeper, ahoy!

“It seems Mr. Xu still prefers Dawn Building No.1.” Zhang Li pursed her lips with a smile, showing an I-knew-it expression, “If so, then I wish Mr. Xu good luck in the Pet Beast Cleaning and Caring Exhibition.”

“I really have to try hard.” Xu Ran smiled and waved goodbye to Zhang Li, then turned to look at the three little ones following him, “Let’s settle the shop matter first, and next we’ll focus all our efforts on competing for the Extinct Thunder Attraction.”

“Meow!” (No problem!)

Ziyun waved its claw, appearing full of enthusiasm.

It would be helpful in Washing and Protection too!

The Extinct Thunder Attraction has been dormant in Fallen Thunder Valley for so long, a few more days won’t make a difference!

And…

Ziyun had a premonition.

When the Extinct Thunder Attraction was about to appear, it might perceive it instinctively.

Because the power of the Extinct Thunder Attraction and the black power that merged with it after it performed Divine Punishment had a slight similarity; there might be some resonance between the two.

With Ziyun expressing this, Star and Cancan naturally had no objections.

“Next, we’ll find a hotel in Bright Radiance City to stay temporarily for two days. When the Pet Beast Cleaning and Caring Exhibition starts, we’ll also get familiar with Bright Radiance City’s environment,” said Xu Ran, stretching languidly and pointing to a hotel not far away.

“That hotel looks good, let’s check it out.”

—————–

Time passed, and two days went by.

In those two days, Xu Ran and the three little ones enjoyed a rare period of calm after the catastrophe in the Monster Wooden Domain. The emotional roller coaster from witnessing the evolution of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood had also stabilized quite a bit due to the new experiences in Bright Radiance City during that time.

And the first battle of Starfire Foster Care Shop in Bright Radiance City was about to begin.

On the first day of the Pet Beast Cleaning and Caring Exhibition, Xu Ran, who had already completed the registration in advance, appeared at the event site with the three little ones.

It was a vast open space where a hundred enclosed Washing and Protection rooms had been temporarily built, each able to accommodate Large Pet Beasts for Washing and Protection.

Caretakers who registered for the exhibition would draw lots to choose their respective Washing and Protection rooms. Over the next two days, they would serve the Beast Masters and their Pet Beasts from all over Bright Radiance City. The Washing and Protection were free, with the Beast Master Association footing the bill for the resources used during the process.

It wasn’t just a stage for the talent in Washing and Protection, but also a small benefit that the Beast Master Association offered to all Beast Masters in Bright Radiance City.

“Hello, I’m Xu Ran, here to register for the exhibition.” Approaching the staff of the organizers, Xu Ran presented his registration proof, “When does the draw for selecting the Washing and Protection room start?”

“The drawing is done on a first-come, first-served basis. Please come this way.” Quickly, the staff member led Xu Ran to the drawing area.

“Chop!” (Let me draw!)

“`

Cancan raised one paw, volunteering spiritedly.

“Let the King of Dragon Turtles, who controls good fortune, draw the best grooming room on the field!”

“Alright, you do it.” Seeing Cancan so excited, Xu Ran smiled and stepped aside.

Cancan walked up confidently, reached a paw into the draw box to feel around, and then pulled out a sealed metal cylinder.

The staff took the metal cylinder, skillfully opened it, and pulled out a rolled-up blueprint, which they spread out to display.

It was a map of all the cleaning and caring rooms at the pet beast exhibition, but one of the rooms was colored strikingly red, unlike the others.

That was the room that Cancan had drawn for Xu Ran.

Upon seeing that location, Cancan’s face, previously full of pride and confidence, instantly fell.

Because that location was not only secluded but also far from the entrance to the exhibit area.

Even without much understanding of the business, Cancan could tell it wasn’t a good spot.

“Chah~” (Darn it, my luck has run out for today…)

The head that had been held high slowly drooped, and its expression immediately wilted.

“It’s alright.” Xu Ran chuckled and patted Cancan’s head to comfort it.

Xu Ran had not expected Cancan’s luck to be so bad.

In such an exhibition, the results of washing and protection were clear to see, the strength and weaknesses could easily be judged even by laymen, and the quality of the grooming room’s location would only have a temporary effect.

It wasn’t a big problem.

“Chah!” (I will work hard to attract customers!)

Cancan took a deep breath and let out a loud shout.

If luck wasn’t helpful, then it would have to rely on hard work!

“Mmm… you keep it up,” Xu Ran said with a smile.

Hopefully, Cancan wouldn’t cause any trouble this time.@@novelbin@@

Taking the indicator map of the drawn grooming room, Xu Ran left with the three little ones and soon arrived in front of his assigned grooming room.

At the entrance of the empty grooming room was a blank white signboard with ink and brushes, available for the caretakers participating in the exhibition to write the name of their grooming room for easy identification and distinction.

After dipping the brush in ink, Xu Ran wrote “Starfire Foster Care Shop” without hesitation. He stepped back two paces to view the overall effect and then nodded in satisfaction.

“Starfire Foster Care Shop?”

A curious voice suddenly came from not far away, as a middle-aged man walked out from the neighboring grooming room, his face bearing a questioning look, “Young man, you seem somewhat unfamiliar, eh?”

“Hello, uncle.” Xu Ran smiled and nodded in greeting, “I haven’t been in Bright Radiance City for long.”

“Ah, I see,” the middle-aged man nodded in understanding, “so this Starfire Foster Care Shop is where you work? How come I’ve never heard of it?”

“Well… this is the shop I’m planning to open,” Xu Ran said with a shy smile.

Middle-aged man: “…”

So, it hasn’t opened yet?

The middle-aged man’s expression relaxed slightly for a moment.

Having drawn a poor lottery position, he no longer held much hope for a good result in this grooming exhibition; if a strong competitor emerged next door, his chances would dwindle even further.

Therefore, upon noticing Xu Ran, the new neighbor, the middle-aged man promptly came over to gather information.

While Xu Ran was young, in Bright Radiance City there were caretakers even younger than him with astoundingly good washing and protection skills; there was no guarantee that this young man wasn’t a dark horse in hiding.

But having heard about Xu Ran’s background, the middle-aged man felt relieved.

From out of town, no shopfront yet.

He wasn’t boasting, but there wasn’t a single city nearby that could match Bright Radiance City in overall cleaning and caring standards!

After all, cities that valued washing and protection services as much as Bright Radiance City did and cultivated such talent were few and far between!

So, it was unlikely that this young man could pose much of a threat.

“Young man, I have good expectations for you.” Thinking this, the middle-aged man slapped Xu Ran’s shoulder with a chuckle, “Drawing adjacent grooming rooms must be fate; let’s look out for each other in the next two days, shall we?”

“Sure,” Xu Ran replied with a smile.

The peers in Bright Radiance City were indeed hospitable.
