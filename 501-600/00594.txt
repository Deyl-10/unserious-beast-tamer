Chapter 594 - 310 First Exploration_3

Xu Ran looked at the Red Fire Crow, "So, the second consciousness inherently resists the preferences and actions of the first consciousness."

"A common term for it is ’contrarianism.’

"If that’s the case, then the personality of the Double-headed Flame Crow must be unchangeable, right?" Du Qian couldn’t contain his curiosity and asked, "Why can it be changed just by ’Washing and Protection’?"

Now looking at the Double-headed Flame Crow again, the two heads seemed especially harmonious, devoid of the previously tense hostility. It seemed as if they had gone from mortal enemies to best pals in an instant.

"Well..." Xu Ran suddenly cracked a smile, "Those skilled in ’Washing and Protection’ would logically be adept at ’brainwashing’ as well, right?"

Du Qian: "???"

Zhou Zhu: "???"

"Just kidding." Xu Ran laughed, "Although the second consciousness of the Double-headed Flame Crow instinctively opposes the first, it doesn’t have any memories of the forced Red Fire Crow."

"Essentially, for the Double-headed Flame Crow, it is simply another self with a defiant nature."

"To make the subconscious of the other fade away, one must first strengthen its identification with the first consciousness."

"Not fond of ’Washing and Protection,’ it gradually began to enjoy ’Washing and Protection’ under my treatment, similar to the first consciousness, which is effectively a silent dissolution of its internal defenses."

"Following that, it’s about using ’Washing and Protection’ techniques to reorganize the power within the Double-headed Flame Crow’s body." The Beast Master of the Double-headed Flame Crow was named Zhou Zhu.

He knew his Pet Beast’s situation like the back of his hand.

As a Transcendent Being with two independent consciousnesses, the evolution of the Double-headed Flame Crow also differs from that of other Transcendent Beings.

Its original species is the Red Fire Crow. To evolve from the Red Fire Crow to the Double-headed Flame Crow, it requires the assistance of another Red Fire Crow.

After the evolution, the assisting Red Fire Crow will permanently lose a portion of its Power, because a part of its Spirit will become the other consciousness of the Double-headed Flame Crow during the evolution.

Furthermore, the assisting Red Fire Crow will lose the possibility of evolving into a Double-headed Flame Crow.

No creature willingly sacrifices itself for others, so Zhou Zhu, desperate to ensure the successful evolution of his Red Fire Crow, had no choice but to capture a wild Red Fire Crow and force it to cooperate with the evolution.

The evolution was successful, but also a failure.

His Red Fire Crow became a member of the King Species, the Double-headed Flame Crow, but the newly born consciousness was too independent and seemed to have solidified the wild Red Fire Crow’s resentment, instinctively clashing with the original consciousness.

Their Power, due to the mismatch between the two consciousnesses, became discordant and stiff, a symptom of which was the darkness and mottled colors within the flames surrounding the Double-headed Flame Crow.

Originally, after countless failed attempts and fruitless visits seeking help from the strong, Zhou Zhu had given up on the thought of improving the Double-headed Flame Crow’s condition.@@novelbin@@

But now, as the flames gushing around the Double-headed Flame Crow gradually became pure and bright, with the mixed colors swiftly reducing, Zhou Zhu’s eyes once again ignited with a flame called hope.

The normally composed big man couldn’t control his emotions and hurried to the front of the "Washing and Protection" platform, leaning over with both hands on the table, staring intently at the Double-headed Flame Crow within arm’s reach, and then spoke with a hesitant voice.

"Boss Xu, can you... solve my Pet Beast’s problem?"

"Let’s give it a try." Xu Ran didn’t make any guarantees but simply smiled mysteriously, his hands continuing their pressing and kneading motions.

His strong hands left indentations on the Double-headed Flame Crow’s body, scraping over the beast’s muscles and bones in the slick oil, with each pressure point fully stimulating the fire Power within the Double-headed Flame Crow’s body.

Once, twice, thrice...

The cries of the Double-headed Flame Crow grew sharper and clearer, and the flames engulfing it became increasingly intense and vibrant.

In the end, Xu Ran released his hands and stepped back a few paces.

With flames shooting up to the sky, the Double-headed Flame Crow flapped its wings and hovered in midair.

Its aura was clearly different from before, the surrounding firelight pure and brilliant, and there was no more disharmony between its two heads.

"This..." Du Qian, who watched the entire process, was dumbfounded and completely bewildered.

"Washing and Protection" in his mind should have been a service to maintain the state of a Pet Beast.

How could it, when performed by Xu Ran, so easily resolve the issue of the Double-headed Flame Crow’s conflicting consciousness?

Before he could voice his question, Zhou Zhu on the other side couldn’t hold back any longer.

"Boss Xu, how exactly did you do it?" His eyes were filled with excitement, "In the years since the Double-headed Flame Crow’s evolution, I’ve visited many evolutionary researchers and powerful Beast Masters."

"They all expressed their helplessness regarding the Double-headed Flame Crow’s problem."

"But you resolved it so simply."

"Well..." Xu Ran smiled, "Because, the problem was actually easy to solve."

"If I’m not mistaken, during the evolution of the Double-headed Flame Crow, you must have forced another Red Fire Crow to cooperate, right?"

"Yes... yes." Zhou Zhu’s expression became somewhat uncomfortable, but he still nodded, "I truly couldn’t find a Red Fire Crow willing to cooperate voluntarily, so I had to resort to this strategy."

"To evolve from a Red Fire Crow into a Double-headed Flame Crow, one needs to absorb part of another of the same species’ Spirit, and the closer the strength of that species is to the Red Fire Crow itself, the easier the evolution." Xu Ran spoke calmly, "But there is one thing to note here."

"That is, Spirit includes the emotions and tenacity of the original Red Fire Crow."
