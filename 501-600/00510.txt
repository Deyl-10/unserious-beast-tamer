Chapter 510: Chapter 287: Conversation with Beast Emperor_2

If it had the chance to speak even a single sentence with the other party during this opportunity, it would feel a bit more at ease.

With this thought in mind, the look in Azure Hawk’s eyes, as it gazed upon Cancan, was filled with even more anticipation.

Come on, rash younger generation boy!

Amidst the breath-held attention of all beings around, Cancan’s head slowly drooped down as before, until it was finally facing directly above the well opening.

In those sparkling golden eyes appeared a hint of contemplative light, and then without any hesitation, Cancan shouted loudly towards the well below.

“Char~” (“Beast Emperor, wake up quickly!”)

As Cancan’s voice spread, the surface of the well within, as expected, once again rippled in layers upon layers.

With the last occurrence as a comparison, anyone could tell that the waves this time were several times more intense.

Along with the surge of the waves, more majestic power belonging to the Beast Emperor started to churn up from the bottom of the Beast Emperor’s Well.

If one could say that the Beast Emperor’s Well was a tightly closed door, and on this side of the door were beings calling for the Beast Emperor, and on the other side was the Beast Emperor himself, then the previous call was like opening a very small crack in the door, only letting through a sliver of light.

This time, it was as if a much larger crack had opened, enough for those outside the door to clearly glimpse the scene inside.

The previously quiet Beast Swarm surrounding the area now once again showed signs of excitement and tension in their gaze.

Undoubtedly, compared to the last time, the chance of this strange human getting a response from the Beast Emperor was much greater this time.

Among the Beast Swarm, the older ones could vaguely remember the grandeur of the past. The ripples stirred up now seemed to vaguely reproduce the scene from those days.

Countless beings held their breath tightly, watching the undulations.

Would the Beast Emperor respond?

Under the tense watch of one human, three guardians, and countless wild Transcendent Beings, the well water that was stirring began to become more and more violent.

The power overflowing from the bottom of the well also started to intensify along with it.

It was as if an invisible hand was slowly yet firmly pushing open that long-sealed door!

Eventually, the turmoil of the well water reached its limit, boiling up as if tumultuously turbulent, and under the gaze of countless beings, the water in the well began to sink rapidly.

Various cheers erupted from all directions.

Many within the Beast Swarm who had experienced this scene knew what it meant.

It signified that the Beast Emperor had responded to Xu Ran!

“Lur!”

Quick, take the opportunity to communicate with the Beast Emperor!

The always calm and gentle Ground Raccoon Clan Leader couldn’t help but let out an excited shout, his gaze urging Xu Ran with a bit of haste, signaling him to quickly speak.

Including the Azure Hawk of the King Stage and other beings, everyone’s gaze froze upon Xu Ran.

Although they were hoping to piggyback on Xu Ran’s call to speak a few words with the Beast Emperor, they definitely had to let this major contributor of the call go first.

In the center of everyone’s attention, a hint of contemplation appeared on Xu Ran’s face.

Truth be told, coming here to see and try to call the Beast Emperor was his sudden idea.

Even at first, he had not considered that the Beast Emperor would respond to him, given that the Beast Emperor had not responded to any other beings for so long.

It was only after Cancan almost succeeded last time that he began to think on his feet about what he should ask the other party.

At this moment, with the well of the Beast Emperor churning with a powerful aura that was uniquely its own, Xu Ran already had an idea in his mind.

He strode forward, placing his hands on the edge of the well, and shouted loudly.

“Pardon the disturbance, Beast Emperor, I wish to know the whereabouts of the Extinct Thunder Attraction?”

Yes, the first question Xu Ran wanted to know was regarding the most pressing issue for him and his three companions.

That was about the whereabouts of the last piece of evolution material for Ziyun.

Xu Ran’s voice echoed within the empty Beast Emperor’s Well, but what answered him was a silence.

“This…”

Viewing this scene, a hint of surprise and bewilderment flashed across Xu Ran’s face.

If he still wasn’t feeling the immense presence of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood, he might even think that this call had failed as well.

Why wouldn’t the other party respond to him?

“Char?” (“Is the Beast Emperor still not fully awake?”)

In Cancan’s still large eyes, a hint of confusion appeared.

It moved closer to the well once more, looking as if it was about to let out a second roar, when the Azure Hawk that had been guarding the surrounding area slightly flapped its wings, using a twist of wind to interrupt Cancan’s action.

“Liu~”

“Humans, you need to wait a while, for even the long-silent Beast Emperor will have some difficulty responding.”

An Azure Hawk chirped softly, its eyes looking toward the mouth of the well, filled with respect and admiration.

Reminded by the King Stage Azure Hawk, Xu Ran also had a moment of realization.

Indeed, when one just wakes up, there is a brief blank in consciousness, commonly known as grogginess.

If the silent state of the Beast Emperor Sky-reaching Xuanmu is also regarded as a deeper level of sleep, then its period of grogginess would naturally be much longer.

Then I’ll just wait patiently a little longer.

The man and his three pets no longer spoke, quietly watching the direction of the well.

One minute… Two minutes…

After about ten minutes of waiting like this, a faint wisp of thought finally emerged from the well.

Just as the King Stage can project the meaning of their words into the minds of other creatures, the moment this thread of thought arrived, all the creatures present understood its meaning.

However, after understanding, Xu Ran’s expression became somewhat deflated.

Because the Beast Emperor’s response was “I don’t know.”

Even a being as powerful as it had no clue about the Extinct Thunder Attraction.

“Meow~” (It seems that the Extinct Thunder Attraction is indeed very difficult to find…)

Ziyun sighed softly, a hint of helplessness crossing its face.

But it quickly turned this helplessness into an even stronger fighting spirit.

If it can’t be found, then search even harder!

Feeling the breath of a living Beast Emperor up close, it could sense the vast gap between itself and the other, like a chasm between Life Levels.

Only through another evolution could it possibly reach such heights.

“Forget it,” Xu Ran quickly adjusted his mood as well.

He had prepared two questions.

Now that the first question had not received a satisfactory answer, it was time to ask the second one quickly!

“Beast Emperor senior, is it possible to transform Beast Field No. 97 into what the Monster Wooden Domain is like now?”

Xu Ran asked softly, his gaze filled with a hint of inquiry.

Even the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood couldn’t change Beast Field No. 47, and it could only occupy a corner and change the area under its control. With Xu Ran’s current strength, such a change was even more out of reach.

But in Beast Field No. 97, with only a few Beast Kings, it might be possible to attempt such a thing.

Having grown close and interacted with Twelve, Xu Ran’s preconceptions about wild Transcendent Beings had dissipated.

Seeing a place like the Monster Wooden Domain that seemed like a Holy Land to both Humans and wild Transcendent Beings, new ideas had begun to form in his heart.

Could he… try as well?

As his question was posed, the breath within the well hesitated for a moment.

It seemed the other party hadn’t expected Xu Ran to ask such a question.

Soon, there was a fluctuation in the breath inside the well.

It wasn’t because it was groggy and needed time to recover, but because it was pondering how to answer his question.

After a good while, a whisper of thought came through.

“Enough power to suppress everything.”@@novelbin@@

“Power?” A trace of surprise appeared in Xu Ran’s eyes.

He had thought that the Beast Emperor would have some special advice, but the final answer turned out to be so simple and brutal.

Yet considering the situation inside the Monster Wooden Domain, Xu Ran’s face revealed a hint of enlightenment.

Indeed, that seemed to be the case.

Didn’t the original Beast Emperor forcibly occupy the Monster Wooden Domain, arbitrarily commanding all creatures not to kill each other? Only after feeling the change in the Monster Wooden Domain did everyone begin to gradually accept and ultimately support the rules set by the Beast Emperor.

Everything followed a gradual process.

And its beginning was indeed power.
