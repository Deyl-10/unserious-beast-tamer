Chapter 557: Chapter 300: Deadwood Springs Anew, Semi-Saint!_4

A terror-inducing, frenzied aura dispersed from every corner of its body.

The five Beast Emperors trembled simultaneously at this moment.

All of them had undergone two evolutions, yet compared to the ordeal of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood, their past evolutions were like mud to clouds.

Is this the evolutionary backlash that the Holy Spirit Race must suffer?

Witnessing the increasingly dangerous aura of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood, they even forgot that they were now captives, thoroughly engrossed in the spectacle.

And the hideous avatar of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood was also reflected in Xu Ran’s eyes.

Standing on the ramparts of Monster Wooden City, staring at the grotesque form of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood, Xu Ran fell silent for a moment before turning to the Broken Jade Kite beside him, “Why is the evolution of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood so difficult?”

In his memory, the evolutionary recordings he saw in Xieyun City didn’t seem to have such a horrifying scenario.

The Broken Jade Kite was no longer bound, but seeing the current situation, it had no intention of leaving. It shook its head when it heard the question.

—————–

In such a circumstance, how could the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood grasp the power of advanced attributes so quickly?!

“This can hardly be considered the Order Attribute, it’s merely a superficial exercise of it,” the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood said, a hint of amusement in its voice, “It’s time to end this.”

“This place, recover faster!”

As the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood spoke again, the previously irreparable void began filling up with countless branches and leaves at a speed visible to the naked eye. Even the Flaming Crow Emperor, buried deep within, felt its power and wounds healing at an accelerating pace.

As the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood had said, at this moment its control of this power was not yet complete, hence its influence was indiscriminate, affecting friend and foe alike.

However, despite the rapid restoration of his power and wounds, the Flaming Crow Emperor’s face showed not a hint of joy.

Because from the very beginning, its consumption had been minimal, and it had not been injured.

Watching helplessly as it was entwined and constrained by countless branches and leaves, seemingly about to be sealed forever, the Flaming Crow Emperor’s eyes flickered with madness.

It let out a fierce screech, the flames around its body burning even more fiercely. Endless fire swept in all directions, and the approaching branches had no choice but to recede from its sharp edge.

Yet before it could catch its breath, the next words from the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood made the Fire Attribute Flaming Crow Emperor feel as if it were in an ice cellar.

“In this place, wood fears not fire!”

“No!!!”

The Flaming Crow Emperor let out an angry shriek, but could only watch as the branches it had forced back a moment ago now swiftly entangled it tightly, rendering it completely immobile.

The eternal flames on its body that could melt metal and dissolve stone, now couldn’t even slightly discolor those branches.

Is this the overwhelming superiority of advanced attributes?

A glimmer of despair emerged in the eyes of the Flaming Crow Emperor.

And it was not the only one feeling despair.

“In this place, flesh loses strength!”

Accompanied by a low shout, the Golden Dragon Emperor felt its boundless strength rapidly diminishing, and could only roar in anger as countless branches bound it tightly, leaving it unable to move an inch.

“In this place, wood fears not cold!”

Amid the indignant cries, the Cold Blue Phoenix King similarly had to submit helplessly.

“In this place, water takes form!”

The Yuan Attribute Beast Emperor, Flood Lake Demon Monarch, which could easily escape through the gaps in the branches by turning into water, was also captured helplessly.

“In this place, wood can conduct electricity!”

The God Lightning Dragon Hawk’s electricity that could pierce through the void became like it had encountered a bottomless pit after the Beast Emperor’s words. It was absorbed by the surrounding branches and directed into the ground below, completely losing its intended potency.

Already restrained by its opposing attribute, it could only smile wryly and stop its attacks, allowing itself to be securely bound by the layers of branches.

In just an instant, the balance of victory had tipped.

In the void, five Beast Emperors were simultaneously sealed by the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood, stripped of the arrogance they had displayed before.

This was the formidable might of the Holy Spirit Race!

If one were to say that the Leader Species, King Species, and Emperor Species represented the continual evolution of life levels and the multistep leaps in power, then the upgrade from the Emperor Species to the Holy Spirit Race far surpassed the previous two evolutions.

It was a leap in Attributes!

Transcendent Beings were no longer bound by the rules of the ten Attributes between heaven and earth; they now possessed their unique Attributes, their unique paths.

Only then, could they be considered holy!

Even just any member of the Holy Spirit Race possessing an Advanced Attribute, when facing an adversary with one of the ten basic Attributes, could perform the same sort of crushing defeat.

Not to mention the ambition of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood, which lay dormant for hundreds of years, just to master the Power of Order, one of the more superior Advanced Attributes.

At this moment, just a shred of that power was enough to easily suppress Beast Emperors of the same life level!

The gap between Advanced Attributes and the ten basic Attributes was like a chasm!

After instantly sealing the five attackers, the indifferent expression of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood suddenly registered a trace of pain.

Ordinary evolution was already going against the natural order, full of difficulties, not to mention this last barrier — evolving from the Emperor Species to the Holy Spirit Race.

The level of difficulty was unimaginable.

At this time, it still had an extremely long way to go to complete its evolution.

In such a situation, forcibly using a power that had just been born, not yet fully integrated into itself, the consequences were predictable.

It would inevitably increase the difficulty of its evolution, but the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood had no choice.

After giving the five Beast Emperors in the void, now unable to interfere with its evolution, a profound look, the ethereal face of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood slowly faded away.

Its aura quickly wilted, and the agitated, anomalous power went rampant over its terrifying canopy that spanned dozens of kilometers.

Its branches and leaves twisted, deformed, and in some areas of the canopy, there appeared the strange phenomenon of branches growing out of leaves, the distortion and chaos making the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood’s appearance become indescribable in an instant, with surges of pain continually radiating into the outside world.@@novelbin@@

That was the backlash of the Power of Order.

Feeling this scene, the five Beast Emperors all quieted down.

They knew all too well that the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood was at a critical moment in its evolution and that with just a little interference, they could cause its evolution to fail and perish on the spot.

But the branches and leaves encasing them had already hardened with the previously exerted Order Force and had been actively disconnected by the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood from each other, now forming independent shackles that would not loosen with the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood’s changes.

This left them with no choice but to helplessly watch a prime opportunity unfold before their eyes, unable to do anything about it.

Time passed, bit by bit.

The anomalous condition of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood grew increasingly wild, its branches even beginning to seep scarlet blood, and its leaves sprouted numerous gruesome and irregular eyes as if its wooden body had morphed into a patchwork of wood and flesh.

An aura of horror and madness permeated every inch of its form.

The five Beast Emperors shuddered together at this moment.

They were elites who had undergone two evolutions, but compared to what the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood was enduring, their past experiences paled in comparison.

Was this the evolutionary backlash of becoming a member of the Holy Spirit Race?

Watching the increasingly dangerous aura of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood, they even forgot that they were now prisoners, engrossed in observing this spectacle.

The grisly form of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood was also reflected in Xu Ran’s eyes.

Standing on the wall of Monster Wooden City and observing the ghastly form of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood, Xu Ran fell silent for a moment before turning to the Broken Jade Kite beside him, “Why is the evolution of the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood so difficult?”

In his memory, the evolution records he saw in Xieyun City did not seem to contain such terrifying circumstances.

The Broken Jade Kite was no longer bound, but seeing the situation at hand, it had no intention to leave and simply shook its head in response.
