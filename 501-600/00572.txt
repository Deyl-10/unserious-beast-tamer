Chapter 572 - 305 Du Huayans Letter

"Indeed, that’s the Starfire Foster Care Shop." Chou Yue nodded, a hint of regret on her face, "If it weren’t for the bad draw of the location, the entrance to that grooming room wouldn’t be so deserted."@@novelbin@@

Having said that, she seemed to realize something and looked at Du Qian with surprise, "You seem to know about this shop?"

"Ah~ I do indeed." Du Qian rubbed his temples, "If it’s him, then it’s not surprising."

At these words, a strong sense of curiosity surged in Chou Yue’s heart. She opened her mouth, about to ask who exactly he was when Jiang Min, who had come back to her senses, quickly interrupted.

"Qi An brother, can we skip the line and get washed and protected first?"

Jiang Min put her hands together and made a cute face, "Qi An brother is really too popular, the queue is just too long, I’ve already waited for more than an hour~"

"Thank you for your support." There was a smile on Du Qian’s face, but just when Jiang Min thought he would agree, he spoke without changing his smile, "But no cutting in line."

Jiang Min: "..."

Gazing past Jiang Min, Du Qian looked towards the long queue behind him, his face also showing a touch of helplessness.

He was well aware of his groom rate; the people currently in line were enough to keep him washing for two days, not to mention more would keep coming.

He sighed slightly and signaled to an assistant not far away.

The assistant understood and quickly handed over a megaphone.

Taking the megaphone, Du Qian spoke out loud, "Dear fellow Beast Masters, I thank you all for your trust and affection, but there are simply too many people in line right now."

"With such a long queue, the wait times will increase accordingly, and it’s even possible that a two-day wait might not ensure service, and that’s something none of us want to see."

"Therefore, I hope you will try other grooming rooms as well. Any grooming room standing here is worthy of your trust."

There was a slight pause in Du Qian’s speech. "If you really aren’t sure which one to choose, you can walk a bit deeper. There’s a grooming room called ’Starfire Foster Care Shop’ that’s worth a try."

As soon as these words came out, applause erupted from the crowd.

With such remarks, it was as if he had opened up the game, making everyone instantly feel even more favorable towards this young caretaker.

The disappointment Jiang Min felt from being refused a chance to skip the line dissipated in an instant, her eyes turning into stars as she looked at Du Qian’s handsome face, so close at hand.

Even Chou Yue revealed a look of surprise and admiration.

To be able to speak such words, Du Qian was indeed not simple.

After Du Qian’s speech, people in the rear of the queue began to disperse, most of them heading deeper as advised.

They wanted to try out the grooming room personally recommended by Du Qian.

Seeing this scene, Du Qian smiled faintly, tossed the megaphone back to his assistant, and turned to enter the grooming room.

The assistant blinked, then quickly followed him in.

"Qi An, why do that?" He complained with some incomprehension, "It’s bad enough pushing customers away, but why go out of your way to recommend another groomer? Isn’t that helping the competition?"

"This is your first grooming exhibition as the chief groomer for the Hundred Flowers Foster Store after taking over from your sister, and winning the ’Cleaning Saint’ title is important!"

"I know." Du Qian smiled and began to clean the grooming table, preparing for the next washing and protection.

"Let me do it." Seeing this, the assistant hurriedly took over the task, grumbling as he cleaned, "If you know, why do it? That ’Starfire Foster Care Shop’ I’ve never even heard of, why help them?"

Smiling silently, Du Qian watched the assistant clean and grumble, recalling the letter his sister had sent some days ago.

At the invitation of the Monster Wooden City Beast Master Association, his sister, who had been the chief groomer at the Hundred Flowers Foster Store, represented the Du family from Bright Radiance City and established a branch of the Hundred Flowers store in Monster Wooden City, prompting his own promotion to chief groomer.

His sister had not severed her links with Bright Radiance City after moving to Monster Wooden City, regularly sending letters back home, writing about her various experiences in Monster Wooden City and expressing her care and greetings to the family.

In her last letter, Du Qian noticed something his sister mentioned, which he found quite intriguing.

In Monster Wooden City, there was a foster care shop named Starfire.

The shop’s owner, like his sister, wasn’t a local of Monster Wooden City but instead had opened a branch store at the invitation of the Monster Wooden City Beast Master Association.

In the letter, his sister repeatedly described the other’s grooming skills with words like "magical," "ingenious," and "astonishing," and the other was also a young person.

This made Du Qian mentally note down this foster care shop, regretting that the other was not in Bright Radiance City and wishing he could witness the other’s grooming skills for himself.

And now, here he was in Bright Radiance City, hearing the same name again.

Combining that with the astonishing state of the girl’s pet beast after grooming, Du Qian was at least seventy percent sure that the other was the person his sister had mentioned.

Despite not knowing why the other had appeared here, Du Qian’s wish to witness the other’s grooming skills was likely to be fulfilled.

No, just witnessing was not enough.

How could he not have a match with such a skilled groomer?

Because a bad location was drawn, the business was quiet?
