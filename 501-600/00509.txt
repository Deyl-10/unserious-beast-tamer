Chapter 509: Chapter 287: Conversation with Beast Emperor

Accompanied by Cancan’s powerful presence, already close to that of a King Stage, and its booming voice shaking the surroundings, the clear water within the Beast Emperor’s Well stirred up ripples, one circle after another.@@novelbin@@

Along with the emergence of the ripples, a powerful and majestic power faintly radiated from the mouth of the well, the direction of its bottom.

That immense power was identically sourced from the sturdiest of woods deep in the forest, the ones that seemed to touch the sky.

It was the aura emanating from the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood.

At this moment, Cancan, which had just a moment ago been bursting with vigor, now shrank back like a mouse who had encountered a cat, quickly retracting its body to a pocket-sized form and obediently hiding behind Xu Ran, occasionally stealing glances at the well’s mouth.

Even as its magnificent presence was now subdued, and all that remained of its previous voice was a faint echo, the ripples in the water within the well did not subside but seemed to grow more intense instead.

Seeing this scene, Xu Ran and the other two little ones held their breath in unison.

Could it be… it really awakened the Beast Emperor?

The Ground Raccoon Clan Leader nearby also couldn’t help but widen its eyes.

It watched the persistent ripples in the well water with slightly hurried breaths.

It vaguely remembered that a long time ago, when their calls to the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood were answered, similar occurrences took place.

Could it be… Xu Ran and his Pet Beast did it?!

Sharing this thought, other wild Transcendent Beings, drawn by Cancan’s earlier commotion, also cast their gazes in this direction.

After a moment of dead silence, a clamor arose all around as various voices of the Transcendent Beings came one after another, and their presences surged forth swiftly.

As weak as those at the Elite Stage, as powerful as the General Stage, they were plentiful and varied.

The Transcendent Beings living in this area appeared all at once, enlivening the previously quiet jungle.

Their gazes towards Xu Ran bore no malice but rather held a hint of curiosity.

After all, after such a long time, there were very few who could cause an anomaly at the Beast Emperor’s Well as easily as the human before them.

“Screech—”

Following a prolonged and sharp cry, a large Azure Hawk with a powerful presence descended swiftly from the high tree canopy.

With its appearance came an aura stronger than Cancan’s earlier peak state, spreading out with a deafening force.

King Stage.

This was a true King Stage creature, a being at the Beast King Level.

As it made its appearance, all the Transcendent Beings that had just emerged bowed their heads unanimously, becoming a bit more subdued.

After the King Stage Azure Hawk landed, its gaze carried a mix of excitement and nostalgia as it stared in the direction of the well’s mouth.

Yet just moments later, the excitement and nostalgia faded somewhat.

After a slight shake of its head, the Azure Hawk locked its gaze on Cancan, the instigator from before, and let out a sharp cry.

“Screech—”

At the same time, the meaning embedded in its call became apparent in the minds of the surrounding creatures.

“Little one, try again.”

Almost simultaneously with the Azure Hawk’s statement, the ripples emanating from within the well began to subside, and, in the end, that powerful aura disappeared completely.

This almost successful call still ended in failure.

It was clear that the King Stage Azure Hawk had already sensed this, which is why it asked Cancan to try again.

“Chaa?” (…Really do it again?)

Seeing the gaze of the Azure Hawk and other surrounding Transcendent Beings, Cancan couldn’t help but draw back its head.

Its heart was also filled with disappointment as it watched the dissipating ripples in the well water.

But at the same time, it was also filled with relief and the fear following its previous recklessness.

Asking it to do it again right now, Cancan felt a little faint-hearted.

“Try again,” Xu Ran pondered for a moment, then stroked Cancan’s head and spoke softly, “This time we were almost successful, maybe next time we will indeed succeed, right?”

“Chaa~” (Then I’ll try again!)

Seeing Xu Ran also encouraging it, Cancan bit its teeth, cheered itself up in its heart, and took another step forward.

“Xi Lu~” (I’ll help you too.)

Starlight crowed, its gaze towards Cancan filled with encouragement.

It thought that Cancan’s failure to awaken the Beast Emperor just now might have been due to insufficient strength.

Therefore, this time it would also join in, using the Night Rune to bolster it, which should make things more certain.

“Chaa!” (Okay!)

Hearing Starlight’s words, Cancan nodded firmly, feeling a bit more confident.

The wild Transcendent Beings that had crowded around, having already witnessed Cancan’s increased body size, now quickly made way, leaving a large empty space.

In the next moment, Cancan shouted loudly as it swiftly grew in size amidst countless watching eyes, its presence climbing higher and higher.

“Xi Lu~”

Starlight roared, and the starlight patterns that faintly covered its body brightened all at once in that moment. An immeasurable dark power soared into the sky, while a complex and pitch-black pattern rapidly emerged on Cancan’s body.

With the enhancement of the Night Rune, Cancan’s presence instantly broke through its previous peak and reached the King Stage level in the astonished gaze of the beasts around, only slightly weaker than the Azure Hawk’s presence.

Feeling this increasingly formidable presence of Cancan, the Azure Hawk’s eyes revealed anticipation.

It couldn’t help but flap its wings and rise into the air, positioning itself above Cancan’s proudly lifted huge head, closely watching Cancan’s next move.

This time… will it awaken the Beast Emperor?

As one of the most loyal subordinates of the Beast Emperor, it had been far too long since it was able to converse with the slumbering Beast Emperor.
