Chapter 616 - 316 Abnormal Foster Care Residents And The Exposed Twelve

[Under revision, check back tomorrow morning]

Compared to the skills of a normal Fire-tailed Bear, the skills of Starfire had clearly ascended a level in terms of strength.

Though it had lost the overall power enhancement of the Fire Attribute known as the "meaning of Flames," the new skill it had acquired, "Undying Flame," was much more dominant. In the current tests, its upper limit was not even discernible.

The only thing probably limiting it was the strength of the caster itself.

Initially, Xu Ran had just felt that Starfire was somewhat special and wanted to buy it to observe. At this moment, he felt like he had stumbled upon a treasure.

If it weren’t for other Beast Masters’ concerns about mutated Pet Beasts lacking subsequent Evolution Paths, such a unique existence as Starfire would have been snapped up quickly, not waiting for him to come and take it away.

After playing with Starfire for a while longer, Xu Ran glanced at the time and stood up, "It’s about time, I need to open the shop."

Visiting the Green Bud Base with the three little ones to see Pet Beasts had almost consumed the entire lunchtime break. Now, the afternoon business hours were upon him.

"Xi Lu~" (I’ll stay here~)

Wind shook its head and let out a whinny.

It was worried that Starfire might be uncomfortable in its new environment and wanted to stay longer to help Starfire acclimate faster—to get to know the place and each other.

Hearing Wind speak up, Ziyun and Cancan also didn’t want to leave.

These days, they had synchronized their training schedules to Xu Ran’s evening meditation time, freeing up their days for other activities.

"Then all three of you can stay," Xu Ran said with a smile. "When the afternoon’s business is over, I’ll make you something delicious."

Hearing about the treats, all three little ones’ eyes lit up in unison.

They eagerly nodded, and seeing the curious expression on Starfire’s face, Cancan quickly patted its shoulder and then gesticulated excitedly about how tasty the Pet Beast Food Xu Ran made was.

After listening, the reddish eyes of Starfire also lit up.

Delicious food! Want to eat!

Seeing the four little ones’ reactions, Xu Ran chuckled, waved at them, and quickly disappeared from the Foster area.

Stepping into the shop, he saw a long queue formed outside the door, stretched lazily, and opened the closed shop door.@@novelbin@@

The afternoon’s business, begun!

-----------------

"Boss Xu, I saw your Price Menu, and besides the Washing and Protection Service, you also offer Foster Care Service?"

"Yes," Xu Ran nodded, eyeing the customer before him.

The Price Menu on the wall was glanced at by every client who entered, but up to this point, services other than Washing and Protection remained unexplored by anyone.

After all, Xu Ran already held the industry’s highest title of "Cleaning Saint" in regards to Washing and Protection, akin to receiving an Association’s endorsement, which warranted the price that was significantly higher compared to other Foster Shops.

But he didn’t have similar honors or recognition for other services, and seeing the equally pricey options, customers inevitably had their hesitations.

Since the opening of the shop, this was the first time someone had inquired about a service beyond Washing and Protection.

The customer was a burly man named Zong Hua who, upon getting a positive response from Xu Ran, took another look at the Foster Care prices on the wall and after some thought made a decision, "I was planning to change my Pet Beast’s Foster Shop. Could I take a look at your Foster area first?"

"Not a problem at all," Xu Ran’s smile grew richer.

True, Starfire was the first resident of the Foster area.

But that wasn’t considered a business deal; it was a different matter entirely.

If this order went through, the Starfire Foster Care Shop in Bright Radiance City would officially be open for business.

He couldn’t help but glance at the Pet Beast following behind Zong Hua—a Pet Beast covered in silver fur, with a humanoid body resembling a primitive warrior exuding a fierce aura.

Fighting King Species, Silver Hair King.

As a notorious King Species within the Fighting Attribute, it was the most loyal guardian in life and a fearsome demon in battle, making adversaries tremble at the very mention.

Just moments ago, this Silver Hair King had received Washing and Protection services at Xu Ran’s, and its gleaming and immaculate appearance now was evidence of its peak condition.

And now, its Beast Master was preparing to entrust it to Xu Ran for Foster Care.

Without a doubt, this would be a wise choice.

"Please follow me," Xu Ran gestured towards the direction of the Foster area, then led the way.

Perfectly timed, as the afternoon business had been running for nearly two hours, and it was a good opportunity to check on what the four little ones were up to.

-----------------

"Huh? Where did they go?"

In the Foster area, looking at the specially constructed living quarters for Starfire, which were completely empty with no sign of it or the three little ones, Xu Ran couldn’t help but voice his confusion.

However, a surprised exclamation next to him quickly brought him back to his senses.

"Boss Xu, this Foster space is much bigger than I imagined," Zong Hua was astounded as he gaped at the immense Foster area, unable to see its borders. While he was filled with amazement, a spark of excitement appeared in his eyes.

Originally, he had only thought of checking out the Foster environment because the Silver Hair King had received much better Washing and Protection than he had expected.

But now, confronted with this extraordinary environment, he was completely convinced.

"That must be the living quarters for the Fire Pet Beast," Zong Hua pointed to the area Xu Ran had built for Starfire, "Where’s the living area for the Fighting Attribute?"
