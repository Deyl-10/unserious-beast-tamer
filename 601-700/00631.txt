Chapter 631 - 319: The Deep Slumber Bird!_4

When the three little ones had all finished their demonstrations, Xu Ran once again met the Nightmare Beast King’s gaze, "Senior, can I enter into a contract with Twelve now?"

The Nightmare Beast King was silent for a moment.

Having witnessed three King Species Pet Beasts display Four Stars Skills, its original perceptions were now strongly challenged.

Without a doubt, for Xu Ran, who had enhanced Three Star Skills into Four Stars, upgrading Two Star Skills to Three Stars would be even simpler.

"Yes," the Nightmare Beast King ultimately nodded.

"Yippee!" (That’s great!)

Cancan couldn’t help but let out a cheer.

Under its influence, Ziyun and Star also cheered in unison.

Looking at the excitement of the three little ones, Xu Ran smiled and then pulled forth the fourth contract slot that had been vacant for some time, and quickly established a contract with Twelve in his arms.

[Host: Xu Ran

Contract Power: Fourth Stage

Contract Pet Beasts:

Ziyun [View Details]

Star [View Details]

Cancan [View Details]

Twelve [View Details]

…]

Looking at his updated personal panel, Xu Ran casually clicked on Twelve’s panel.

[Contract Pet Beast: Twelve

Race Name: Velvet Sparrow

Attribute: Super ability Attribute

Growth Step: Elite Stage (20000/20000)

Species Rank: Leader Species

Skills:

[★★ Order of No Conquest (Full Moon Level)] (0/10000)

[★★ Illusory Scenery (Full Moon Level)] (0/10000) [+]

[★★ Shadow of Deterrence (Waning Moon Level)] (968/2000) [+]

[★★ Soul Shatter Roar (Waning Moon Level)] (122/2000) [+]

[★ Mind Induction (Waning Moon Level)] (312/2000) [+] ]

It was clear that Twelve had not been idle during their time apart.

Not only did it acquire a second Full Moon Level skill, but it also upgraded Soul Shatter Roar from Starlight Level to Waning Moon Level.

With this, the requirements for Evolution Proficiency were thoroughly met.

All that was lacking now was to upgrade the Talent Skills.

"Cheep~" (I’ve finally waited for this day!)

Twelve also let out a cheer, but quickly noticed its old father’s strange look and suddenly turned demure again.

With a resigned sigh in his heart, the Nightmare Beast King looked at Xu Ran and suddenly flapped a wing.

One after another, resources appeared in front of Xu Ran.

Dreamer’s Shadow, Dream Weaving Silkworm Silk, Fantasy Crystals, Life Dewdrop, Transcendence Flower.

At a glance, Xu Ran recognized these as the resources needed for Twelve’s Evolution.

The next moment, the Nightmare Beast King slashed one wing with the other, creating a savage wound, then extracted a droplet of blood glowing with rich blue-purple light, allowing it to float in front of Xu Ran.

Superpower-tier King Level Blood Essence.

With this, all the Evolution Materials for Twelve had been gathered.

A look of astonishment appeared on Xu Ran’s face.

He had originally thought to gather the needed materials for Twelve after contracting it, but the Nightmare Beast King had preemptively accomplished this step.

And the surprises the Nightmare Beast King had for Xu Ran didn’t end there.

"I have already conquered Beast Field number 97 and can summon tens of thousands of wild Transcendent Beings any time to perform mass hypnosis, fulfilling the Evolution Ritual requirement for Twelve," the Nightmare Beast King said to Xu Ran, pausing for a moment.

"Now, can the Talent Skills for Twelve be upgraded?" Equally stunned, Twelve, who was nestled in Xu Ran’s arms, began to wonder.

That isn’t right, is it?

Something’s off here!

When did Star also acquire Four Stars Skills?

The skill Ziyun just used didn’t look like Immortal Body, did it?

How come they have new Four Stars Skills after such a short time apart?

Securely in its father’s bosom, Twelve felt a slight resentment.

If it hadn’t been captured by its dear dad, it might have had Four Stars Skills by now!

Immediately after, it turned its gaze to Cancan, who was stepping forward.

This guy, he wouldn’t have a new Four Stars Skill too, would he?

The next moment, Twelve found a small consolation from Cancan’s performance.

Fortunately, the Four Stars Skill Cancan had was still the same one as before.

The Nightmare Beast King fell into a brief silence.

Witnessing three King Species Pet Beasts unleash Four Stars Skills, its original perceptions were now strongly challenged.

Without a doubt, if Xu Ran could upgrade Three Star Skills to Four Stars, then upgrading Two Stars Skills to Three Stars would be even more straightforward.

"Agreed," the Nightmare Beast King finally nodded.

"Chaq!" (Fantastic!)

Cancan couldn’t help but cheer out loud.

Under its influence, Ziyun and Star also cheered together.

Watching the excited little ones, Xu Ran smiled and then drew forth the fourth contract slot that had been empty for a long time and swiftly formed a contract with Twelve in his arms.

[Host: Xu Ran

Contract Power: Fourth Stage

Contract Pet Beasts:

Ziyun [View Details]

Star [View Details]

Cancan [View Details]

Twelve [View Details]

...]

Looking at the updated personal panel in front of him, Xu Ran casually clicked open Twelve’s panel.

[Contract Pet Beast: Twelve

Race Name: Velvet Sparrow

Attribute: Super ability Attribute

Growth Stage: Elite Stage (20000/20000)

Race Rank: Leader Species

Skills:

[★★ Order of No Conquest (Full Moon Level)] (0/10000)

[★★ Illusory Scenery (Full Moon Level)] (0/10000) [+]

[★★ Shadow of Deterrence (Waning Moon Level)] (968/2000) [+]

[★★ Soul Shatter Roar (Waning Moon Level)] (122/2000) [+]

[★ Mind Induction (Waning Moon Level)] (312/2000) [+] ]

It was evident that during their separate time, Twelve had been anything but idle.

Not only had it acquired a second Full Moon Level skill, but it also upgraded the previously Starlight Level Soul Shatter Roar to Waning Moon Level.

With this, the proficiency requirements for evolution were thoroughly met.

All that was missing was the upgrade of Talent Skills in terms of stars.

"Jiu~" (I have finally waited for this day!)

Twelve also cheered, but it quickly noticed its father’s unusual gaze and quickly became docile again.

With a helpless sigh in his heart, the Nightmare Beast King looked towards Xu Ran and suddenly flapped its wings.

One after another, resources appeared in front of Xu Ran.

Fantasy Crystals, Dream Weaving Silkworm Silk, Fantasy Crystals, Life Dewdrop, Transcendence Flower.

With just a glance, Xu Ran recognized these as the resources needed for Twelve’s evolution.

The next moment, the Nightmare Beast King slashed fiercely at one of its wings with the other, leaving a ferocious wound, then extracted a droplet of richly colored blue-purple light and allowed it to float toward Xu Ran.

Superpower-tier King Level Blood Essence.

With this, all the materials for Twelve’s evolution were assembled.@@novelbin@@

Surprise crossed Xu Ran’s face.

He had been planning to gather the materials that Twelve needed as quickly as possible after forming the contract, but he never expected that the Nightmare Beast King had already taken this step ahead.

And the surprises that the Nightmare Beast King brought to Xu Ran didn’t stop there.

"I have already conquered Beast Field No. 97 and can summon tens of thousands of wild Transcendent Beings at any moment for a group hypnosis to meet Twelve’s Evolution Ritual requirements," said the Nightmare Beast King, pausing slightly as it looked towards Xu Ran.

"Now, can we upgrade the stars of Twelve’s Talent Skills?" Equally stunned was Twelve, curled up in Xu Ran’s arms.

That’s not right.

Something’s not right!

Since when did Star also master a Four Stars Skill?

The skill Ziyun used earlier didn’t seem like its previous Immortal Body, did it?

How long have they been apart, and they already have new Four Stars Skills?

In an instant, Twelve felt a slight resentment towards its father.

If it hadn’t been caught by its father, it might have had Four Stars Skills by now!

It immediately turned its gaze to Cancan, who was stepping forward.

This fellow couldn’t have a new Four Stars Skill too, could he?

The next moment, Twelve found some consolation from Cancan’s performance.

Thank goodness, the Four Stars Skill Cancan had was still the previous one.

After the three little ones completed their showcase, Xu Ran once again exchanged glances with the Nightmare Beast King,
