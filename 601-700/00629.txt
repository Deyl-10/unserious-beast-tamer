Looking at the updated personal panel in front of him, Xu Ran casually clicked on Twelve’s panel.

[Contract Pet Beast: Twelve

Race Name: Velvet Sparrow

Attribute: Super Ability Attribute

Growth Stage: Elite Stage (20000/20000)

Race Stage: Leader Species

Skills:

[★★Order of No Conquest (Full Moon Level)](0/10000)

[★★Illusory Scenery (Full Moon Level)](0/10000)[+]

[★★Shadow of Deterrence (Waning Moon Level)](968/2000)[+]

[★★Soul Shatter Roar (Waning Moon Level)](122/2000)[+]

[★Mind Induction (Waning Moon Level)](312/2000)[+]]

It was clear that during their time apart, Twelve had not been idle.

Not only had it acquired a second Full Moon Level skill, but it had also elevated the previously Starlight Level Soul Shatter Roar to Waning Moon Level.

With that, the requirements for evolution proficiency were now fully met.

The only thing lacking was the upgrading of the Talent Skills.

"Chiu~" (I’ve finally waited for this day!)

Twelve also let out a cheer, but quickly noticed the odd look in its father’s eyes, and suddenly became obedient again.

Sighing helplessly in his heart, the Nightmare Beast King looked at Xu Ran and suddenly fluttered his wings.

A series of resources appeared in front of Xu Ran.

Dreamer’s Shadow, Dream Weaving Silkworm Silk, Fantasy Crystals, Life Dewdrops, Transcendence Flower.

At a glance, Xu Ran recognized these as the resources needed for Twelve’s evolution.

The next moment, the Nightmare Beast King violently slashed one wing with the other, leaving a vicious wound, then extracted a drop of blood glowing with rich blue-purple light, and floated it in front of Xu Ran.

Superpower-tier King Level Blood Essence.@@novelbin@@

With that, all of Twelve’s materials for evolution were assembled.

Astonishment spread across Xu Ran’s face.

He had initially planned to gather the materials Twelve needed as soon as he contracted with it, but he hadn’t expected the Nightmare Beast King to already have taken care of it.

And the surprises that the Nightmare Beast King brought to Xu Ran didn’t end there.

"I have already conquered Beast Field number 97 and can summon tens of thousands of wild Transcendent Beings at any time to perform a mass hypnosis, fulfilling the requirements for Twelve’s Evolution Ritual."

The Nightmare Beast King looked at Xu Ran, his voice pausing slightly.

"Can we now upgrade Twelve’s Talent Skill?" Also dumbstruck was Twelve, nestled in Xu Ran’s arms.

Wait a minute?

This isn’t right!

Since when did Star also have Four Star Skills?

The ability Ziyun just used didn’t seem to be the Immortal Body from before, right?

How long had it been since he last saw them, and they already had new Four Star Skills?

In an instant, Twelve felt a twinge of resentment towards its dad.

Had it not been captured by its father, perhaps it would have had a Four Star Skill by now!

Immediately after, it turned its gaze to Cancan who was stepping forward.

This fellow wouldn’t have a new Four Star Skill too, would they?

The next moment, Twelve found some comfort in Cancan’s performance.

Thank goodness, the Four Star Skill Cancan mastered was still the previous one.

Once the three little ones had finished their displays, Xu Ran looked at the Nightmare Beast King once again, "Elder, may I now contract with Twelve?"

The Nightmare Beast King fell silent for a moment.

Having personally witnessed three King Species Pet Beasts display Four Star Skills, its original beliefs were severely shaken.

Without a doubt, for Xu Ran who could elevate Three Star Skills to Four Stars, upgrading Two Stars to Three Stars would be even simpler.

"You may." Eventually, the Nightmare Beast King nodded.

"Cha!" (That’s great!)

Cancan couldn’t help but cheer.

Influenced by Cancan, Ziyun and Star also joined in the jubilation.

Looking at the excitement of the three little ones, Xu Ran smiled and then extended the fourth contract slot that had been empty for a long time. He quickly formed a contract with Twelve, nestled in his arms.
