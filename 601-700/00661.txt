Chapter 666 - 329: Thunder Stirs In All Directions, Xu Ran Makes A Move

```

"Zzzap―"

Accompanied by a sharp and piercing boom that came out of nowhere, a deep purple-black bolt of lightning cleaved from the void, fiercely striking the ground and shattering the already pitted earth even further.

Standing not far from the impacted area, Xu Ran quietly watched the rising dust and then couldn’t help but let out a light sigh, "It seems that it is indeed not far from its emergence."

At this moment, they were still at some distance from Fallen Thunder Valley, yet the world-ending thunder had already reached such an expansive range.

Compared to Xu Ran’s first sight of Fallen Thunder Valley, the fluctuations of the Extinct Thunder Attraction had become unfathomably stronger.

Such a commotion could no longer be concealed.@@novelbin@@

Xu Ran could already feel that coveted gazes were being cast from all directions, with a considerable number of creatures approaching this place.

"Meow?" (Shall we enter Fallen Thunder Valley now?)

Ziyun asked, struggling to contain itself.

As the emergence of the Extinct Thunder Attraction drew nearer, its senses became clearer and clearer. Even standing outside of Fallen Thunder Valley, it could feel the force within the valley, which appeared in its perception as clear as the blazing sun.

The Extinct Thunder Attraction had fully awakened.

"Wait a little longer," Xu Ran said softly after surveying the surroundings, "Right now, inside Fallen Thunder Valley, there’s only the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow."

"The Extinct Thunder Attraction is not a resource it can absorb easily."

"Xi Lu~" (Other creatures are approaching, and there are quite a few of them.)

Star powerfully neighed, warily scanning the surroundings.

Almost the moment after it warned them, silhouettes rapidly approached from afar, appearing not too far from where Xu Ran stood.

They looked at Fallen Thunder Valley with eyes filled with vigilance and desire, followed by a contemplative glance towards Xu Ran, who had arrived earlier.

The scene fell into a brief silence.

The next moment, Cancan couldn’t help but nudge Ziyun with its paw.

"Chirp~" (There seems to be a Fighting Beast King over there!)

Xu Ran and his Pet Beasts looked in the direction of the sound and soon saw a towering figure with arms crossed and standing upright.

It was a Transcendent Being covered in white bone armor, pulsating with a strong and fierce aura.

As Cancan had said, this was a Beast King of the Fighting Attribute.

Drawn by the commotion, not only Thunder Attribute Extraordinary Beings had come, but other Attributes were well represented.

And the Fighting Beast King, upon detecting Cancan’s gestures, casually pulled a giant bone saber off its back. The blade pointed distantly in Xu Ran’s direction, its indestructible bone structure trembling and echoing a dull sound through the void.

"You human ant, what is here?"

"Chirp?" (Does this guy really need a beating?)

Cancan’s eyes quickly flashed with displeasure. Just as it was about to revert from its compact size to its original form, revealing the formidable presence of having broken through to the King Stage, it was restrained by a hand from Xu Ran.

Giving Cancan a slight shake of his head to indicate that it was not yet the time to reveal its strength, Xu Ran calmly turned towards the Fighting Beast King, "There’s a piece of Thunder Resources that has appeared here, very precious. As for other things, I have just arrived and am not very clear about them."

"Thunder Resources..." The Fighting Beast King fell silent for a moment, staring at Fallen Thunder Valley, which was within arm’s reach.

It could naturally sense the rich Thunderforce inside, but this was not enough to make it back down.

In the wilderness, such unclaimed precious resources were not common; each one was extremely valuable. Even if the Attributes didn’t match, they would still try to seize the opportunity to snatch them.

If one were lucky enough to actually seize one, they could try to exchange it with other Transcendent Beings in need of that specific resource for a large amount of resources, which was a significant gain in itself.

There were not a few Beings holding a similar notion as the Fighting Beast King in the vicinity. None of the non-Thunder Extraordinary Beings present had any intention of leaving.

After a moment’s silence, another Being, a giant lion ablaze with red flames, let out a hoarse and vicious growl.

"White Bone, this is the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow’s territory."

"Securing this resource won’t be easy."

"Rushing in recklessly, we have to pay a price, but it seems some creatures do not deserve to contend with us for this opportunity."

As it spoke, the Being exuded unmistakable malice, its gaze sweeping over Xu Ran and several Extraordinary Beings at the scene that had not yet reached the King Stage level.

"Flame Lion, I understand what you’re implying." The White Bone King nodded slightly, and within its empty skull eye sockets, a bloodthirsty crimson glittered, "Clear the field."

The instant these words landed, it, holding the massive bone saber in hand, began to walk towards Xu Ran step by step.

Clearly, it had chosen Xu Ran as the first target in its clearing operation.

Among all present were Transcendent Beings, and the only human naturally had to be eliminated first.

The Flame Lion Beast King grinned viciously, throwing itself toward an innocent General stage Extraordinary Being not far away without hesitation.

Several other Beast Kings also began to target General stage Extraordinary Beings nearby.

"Meow~" (This guy seems to be as strong as the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King?)

As it watched the White Bone Beast King closing in, Ziyun’s sharp claws sprang out from its paws, its heterochromatic eyes constricted, locking onto the White Bone Beast King like the abyss itself.

Having met all the Evolution Conditions, it was conveniently in need of claiming the life of a Fighting Beast King. Since this fool dared to provoke, it had chosen him.

Cancan, who had wanted to show off its strength, felt Ziyun’s rising intent to kill and, remembering Ziyun’s Evolution Ritual, couldn’t help but shrink back a little.
