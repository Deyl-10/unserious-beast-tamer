Looking at the rows of words before him, Xu Ran couldn’t help but reveal a look of amazement on his face.

Before today, he knew that there was a significant gap between King Species and Emperor Species, but only upon seeing the specific data did he realize how large it really was.

Cancan, who is also at the Monarch Stage, only has a power progression cap of 600w, while Ziyun has a full ten million.

This nearly double power gap means that Ziyun could effortlessly thrash several Cancans.

And that’s just the pure difference in strength. If one considers the overpowering force of the Imperial Crown, an exclusive skill of the Emperor Species, Ziyun’s strength would be even more formidable.

Having grasped an idea of Ziyun’s current strength, Xu Ran immediately looked at Ziyun’s skill list.

Beneath the original seven skills, there were two new ones.

Apart from the Imperial Crown, there was one called Cloud Break Sky.

"Ziyun, what does Cloud Break Sky do?" Xu Ran asked curiously.

"Meow!" (Watch this!)

Wearing a proud expression, Ziyun immediately began to showcase its ability.

It tilted its head slightly towards the sky, and then lifted a paw, pressing it into the air in front of it.

"Zzzap—"

An electric sound of air being pierced by thunderbolt resonated, and instantly, a condensed form of thunderous light gathered beneath its feet.

With another step, another fragment of thunderous light was fixed in the void.@@novelbin@@

One step... two steps...

With each step Ziyun took, a path of thunder quickly formed in the void.

It walked through the void on thunderous light as if on flat ground.

"Is this... flying?" Xu Ran’s face showed a hint of surprise.

Previously, even though Ziyun had a skill like Path of Destruction, it only helped with speed and did not grant the ability to fly.

Now, with such leisurely movement, Ziyun still managed to stay in the air, which undoubtedly meant that it truly possessed the ability to fly.

For a moment, Xu Ran’s expression became a bit strange.

He remembered wanting a Pet Beast that could fly, one that could carry him to experience the joy of flying through the skies.

After the Twelve Evolution, it indeed could fly, but it was still far from being able to carry him in flight.

He never expected that Ziyun would realize this little dream of his first.

"Meow~" (That’s not all~)

Ziyun’s face carried a hint of a smile.

A four-star skill with only a simple ability like flying would be a bit underwhelming.

Its speed suddenly increased, turning into a faint purple streak, and in the blink of an eye, it was already at an altitude of several hundred meters.

Astonishing waves of air accompanied by a torrent of energy spiraled rapidly at its side, gathering and growing in strength with Ziyun’s increased speed, until ultimately reaching an awe-inspiring level that left Xu Ran and the other little ones wide-eyed and slack-jawed.

In the next moment, Ziyun, while sprinting, suddenly struck towards the thunder cloud in the sky that had not yet completely dissipated.

The gathered energy found its outlet, unleashing like a terrifying cannon, enveloping power that seemed capable of annihilating anything, and heavily bombarding the thunder cloud.

The thunder cloud in the void was completely dispersed, and the terrifying energy continued unabated, blasting towards an unknown location in the void.

Only after fully executing Cloud Break Sky did Ziyun leisurely return to Xu Ran’s side, showing off a proud look on its face.

"Meow?" (Impressive, right?)

"Impressive, I feel that once it levels up to Violent Sun Level, it won’t be inferior to your other offensive skills," Xu Ran said seriously, "So, what exactly does this skill do?"

"Meow~" (This skill…)

Ziyun explained with a smiling face.

Flying was merely a minor ability that came with Cloud Break Sky.

The true effect of Cloud Break Sky was to accumulate power and then release it all at once, and the way it gathered power was somewhat unique.

Speed.

The faster Ziyun moved, the quicker it could accumulate power, and the resulting force would be even more astonishing.

"So... you didn’t fully use this skill just now?" After hearing about the skill’s effect, Xu Ran raised his eyebrows slightly, "Your fastest speed is under Path of Destruction. If you used Cloud Break Sky with Path of Destruction..."

"Meow~" (Exactly!)

Ziyun nodded with a smile.

On its own, this skill wouldn’t differ much from the other offensive skills, but when coupled with the acceleration from Path of Destruction, the damage from this skill could increase exponentially.

In this way, Cloud Break Sky would become Ziyun’s strongest offensive skill after Divine Punishment.

However, Divine Punishment had side effects, Cloud Break Sky did not.

"That’s fantastic," Xu Ran said, his face reflecting a relieved smile, "Just this skill alone makes the evolution worth it."

"Meow~" (I went through a lot of hardships to gain this.)
