Chapter 633 - 320: The Brand New Form Of Twelve!_2

```

"So soon?" Xu Ran’s heart skipped a beat, and his expression quickly became tense.

When the three little ones evolved into King Species before, although there were also moments of life-or-death crisis, those only occurred after the evolution had progressed to a certain extent.

Had it become so dangerous just after Twelve swallowed the resources?

"This must be related to my blood," said the Nightmare Beast King standing beside, his voice growing deeper. "Evolution requires the Blood Essence of a Superpower-tier King Level, but I am not a common King Stage."

"My blood, is stronger."

"However, there’s no need to worry too much," the Nightmare Beast King, keeping a close eye on Twelve’s current abnormalities, continued slowly. "The Blood Essence obtained by you humans usually comes from a host that has long since perished, but I am still alive, right here."

"This is my blood, how could I let it harm my daughter?" Pride shone in the eyes of the Nightmare Beast King, "Watch, even if Twelve evolves into a Sleeping bird, it will certainly not be an ordinary one."

As if in response to the words of the Nightmare Beast King, the power inside Twelve that had been undergoing frenzied backlash, as though a pause button had been pressed, calmed down.

Yet Twelve’s own perception of the situation was completely different.

Those violent, chaotic powers fought each other within its body, riddling its form with countless internal wounds. But when the Blood Essence carrying those powers made contact with Twelve’s injuries, with its own blood, everything changed.

The originally silent Blood Essence seemed to awaken in that moment, bursting out with a terrifyingly powerful presence. One could even glimpse the massive form of a Demon Hawk flashing within the blood light.

And the target of this rising momentum was not Twelve.

It suppressed all conflicting energies from the evolutionary resources in a brutal, unreasonably forceful manner.

Like a father holding down the head of a scoundrel harming his own daughter, drowning him in water, the dominant power integrated all other powers into the Blood Essence.

The most arduous process of evolution is undoubtedly the gradual absorption of disparate Evolution Materials and the ultimate consolidation of their power into one’s own.

However, now, the power hidden within the Blood Essence was undertaking a similar action.

It slowly shattered and blended the powers that had merged into the Blood Essence, eventually integrating the fully merged minor portion along with some Blood Essence into Twelve’s body.

Bit by bit. After a deep breath, Twelve’s gaze finally landed on the stack of resources placed at the side of the platform.

Each of these resources was pulsing with immense energy, any single one equivalent to the total sum of all the forces within its body.

And now, it was about to swallow these resources in one go, absorbing their energy completely as a means to fuel its own evolution.

Undoubtedly, this process was fraught with danger; a slight miscalculation could lead to being burst by the overwhelming energy and dying on the spot.

But, this was an ordeal all evolved beings had to face.

Without hesitation, Twelve swallowed all the resources in one go.

Lastly, it drained the drop of Blood Essence from its own father to the very last.

That Blood Essence, full of life and power, became the solvent for all others. It merged all the resources into a single crucible, exacerbating the conflict between differing energies to the most intense point in an instant.

Twelve’s sea-blue eyes filled with pain in that moment.

It felt as though several forces were waging war within its body, fighting independently and completely disregarding its life or death.

They ruthlessly ravaged Twelve’s internal structure, rapidly weakening its vitality within a brief period.

Yet, as the vitality dwindled, the energy fluctuations around Twelve were rising at an alarmingly fast rate. This extreme contrast signaled the beginning of an evolution gone awry.

"So soon?" Xu Ran’s heart skipped a beat, and his expression quickly became tense.
