Chapter 641 - 322: The Trail Of The Sparrow Behind The Scenes_2

Fortunately, Twelve quickly gave a positive response.

"Jiu~" ("There’s a way.")

As the daughter of the Nightmare Beast King who had spent a lot of time with the Beast King, Twelve was particularly sensitive to the aura of the Beast King Level.@@novelbin@@

If she could just make one trip to Fallen Thunder Valley, she was confident that she could confirm whether a powerful Beast King coveting the Extinct Thunder Attraction had left a mark.

"Cha!" ("No time to waste, let’s go tonight!")

Cancan shouted loudly, her eyes filled with excitement.

She, Cancan the Explorer, was about to make a comeback!

"Meow~" ("First, let’s tell Xu Ran about this.")

Ziyun took a deep breath and linked to the busy Xu Ran through Contractual Sensing.

Inside the cleaning and caring room, Xu Ran’s hand, which was attending to a Pet Beast, paused slightly.

What does that mean?

According to Twelve’s speculation about wild Extraordinary Creatures, could there be more than one Beast King eyeing the Extinct Thunder Attraction aside from Thunder Patterned Gold Willow?

Suddenly, he felt a headache coming on.

This could be troublesome.

Fortunately, Twelve also said it wasn’t a certainty.

Whether it’s true or not required an actual investigation.

"Boss Xu? Is there some problem with my Pet Beast?" The customer who had been closely watching Xu Ran’s movements became anxious as Xu Ran paused and couldn’t help but ask.

Even the utterly pleased Pet Beast gave a look of silent reproach at this moment.

Will you please continue?

"Ah, sorry," Xu Ran quickly apologized, focusing his attention back on the washing and protection, and responded to the four small creatures through Contractual Sensing.

"We act tonight." This was their first mission together since he had made a contract with Twelve and its buddies.

He must exert a part of his own strength to succeed!

And in this regard, Twelve had an advantage that the other three did not possess.

It came from the Beast Field, from the group of wild Extraordinary Creatures.

It knew the wild Extraordinary Creature Group better than Xu Ran and the other three.

After pondering for a moment, Twelve suddenly spoke up.

"Jiu~" ("If I’m not mistaken, the powerful creature that found the Extinct Thunder Attraction is probably not just Thunder Patterned Gold Willow.")

"Meow?" ("Are there others?")

Ziyun was taken aback and couldn’t help but ask, her expression becoming much more serious.

According to the information they had gathered earlier, only Thunder Patterned Gold Willow and the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King were guarding the Extinct Thunder Attraction, with the latter already ambushed and successfully killed by them.

Logically, it should only be the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow that might threaten them.

Hearing Ziyun’s perplexity, Twelve shook its head slightly.

"Jiu~" ("In the wild, if Extraordinary Creatures find a resource that is useful to them but cannot be obtained immediately, guarding it is just one of the options.")

"Jiu~" ("Besides, there are those who, after ensuring the safety of the resource, will leave their mark and surveillance methods, and then lie in wait.")

(In general, the latter are more dangerous than the former.)

(Because the former is also their hunting target.)

"Xi Lu~" ("Could it really be so?")

Star neighed, and upon hearing Twelve’s words, its expression turned serious.

If what Twelve said was true, could there be one or even several more powerful Extraordinary Creatures lurking in the dark, eyeing the Extinct Thunder Attraction alongside Thunder Patterned Gold Willow and the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King?

"Meow~" ("Then is there a way to discover them?")

Ziyun became anxious.

The unknown was the most terrifying.

Not knowing how many Beast Kings they would have to fight for the power of the Extinct Thunder Attraction made them feel a restless anxiety.

Fortunately, Twelve quickly gave a positive response.
