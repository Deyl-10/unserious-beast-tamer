Chapter 644 - 323 Psychiatrist Twelve

[Content incomplete, to be supplemented]

"Knock, knock, knock~"@@novelbin@@

Accompanied by a sequence of somewhat dull knocking sounds, the door was swiftly opened from the inside.

The one who opened the door was a girl who looked to be about seven or eight years old, dressed in a cute princess dress, seemingly ready to go out and play.

"Daddy!" Upon seeing Zong Hua outside the door, the girl’s face immediately burst into a brilliant smile and swiftly threw herself at him; however, when she saw the somewhat shifty figure behind Zong Hua, her face quickly turned pale.

As if the terrible scene from half a year ago had flashed through her mind again, the girl screamed and quickly backed away.

Zong Hua’s wife, upon hearing the noise, hurried over and embraced the girl, gently patting her back to soothe her. After seeing Silver Hair King, her face clouded with displeasure, "Husband?"

"I’ve decided to have Silver Hair King move back in with us," Zong Hua walked inside, speaking sternly, "It’s not been happy outside, and it didn’t do anything wrong back then. If it weren’t for it, Ru might not be with us anymore."

"I know, but Ru is very scared, and she’ll keep having nightmares with Silver Hair King in the house," Zong Hua’s wife said helplessly.

"Regarding that matter, please let my Pet Beast help," Xu Ran, who followed Zong Hua into the Zong Family home, said with a smile.

"Who are you?" Zong Hua’s wife only now noticed Xu Ran, who had entered the house with her husband.

"This is Xu Ran, the owner of the Foster Shop where Silver Hair King is currently staying," Zong Hua took the initiative to introduce, "He has a Pet Beast that can help Ru."

"If you don’t mind, please let me try," Xu Ran said softly, touching Twelve, which was on his shoulder.

"This..." Zong Hua’s wife couldn’t help but look towards Zong Hua, and after a glance between the spouses, she slowly let go of her daughter, "Thank you."

Zong Ru, amidst her sobs, also heard the conversation of the adults, wiped her tears, and slowly stood up.

The next moment, she walked toward the couch on her own, laid down, and closed her eyes, quickly drifting into dreamland.

Twelve extracted an invisible thread from Zong Ru’s body, then fluttered its wings, hovering above Zong Ru.

Its azure blue eyes shimmered with light, and where its gaze fell, Zong Ru’s body underwent a strange transformation, becoming like a transparent vessel containing a swirling mass of grey-black mist.

Having witnessed countless dreams during the Evolution Ritual, Twelve was well aware that this color of mist represented that Zong Ru was currently experiencing a nightmare.

Connecting their hearts, Twelve entered into Zong Ru’s nightmare the next moment.

-----------------

"No...don’t, don’t come over!"

Zong Ru screamed, frantically running through the empty and secluded streets, with two fierce figures closely following behind her.

One of the figures was already torn apart, and from its tattered body, one could vaguely make out that it was a wolf-type pet beast.

This torn-apart body, which now in Zong Ru’s dream had not lost the ability to move, had vicious claws proliferating from every split in its form, allowing the beast to sprout countless legs and move swiftly.

The vision of multiple maws filled with sharp teeth emitting fierce and terrifying howls was enough to strike fear into the hearts of those who heard.

The other monster was equally terrifying, if not more so.

It was covered in indistinct blood, intermixed with fragments of viscera and shredded flesh of unknown origin. Even without being close, one could almost be overwhelmed by the terrifying smell of blood, endowing it with a demonic and extraordinary terror.

Chased by such horrifying creatures, Zong Ru’s face was distorted by fear as she ran relentlessly but could not escape the pursuit of the monsters behind her.

A sense of despair spread throughout the dreamscape.

When Twelve appeared in the dream, what it saw was the scene before its eyes.

The figure covered in flesh and viscera was grotesquely distorted by nightmare imagery but could still be recognized as Silver Hair King.

Seeing Zong Ru’s incredibly frightened appearance, Twelve sighed softly and then fluttered its wings.

The next moment, the entire dreamscape began to fracture like a broken mirror, revealing cracks which ultimately dissolved into myriad bubbles and vanished.

As the previous scene dissipated, the surroundings quickly changed.

The deserted street gradually filled with blurred figures and sounds of hawkers mingled with the aroma of various foods.

The only distinct figures were Zong Ru and the towering Silver Hair King behind her.

The two walked through the streets; at this moment, Zong Ru was not frightened of Silver Hair King and was even occasionally chatting merrily with it.

Twelve watched all this in silence.

It knew that all dreams were grounded in real memories, and what it was seeing now was the real memory segment corresponding to the nightmare that haunted Zong Ru.

This was the unique power of the Sleeping bird, born of absorbing the dreams of ten thousand beings during its evolution, an instinct that manifested during its transformation.

The memory continued, and a pet beast resembling a wolf-dog crossed the street and approached Zong Ru and Silver Hair King.

Confronted by this unfamiliar pet beast, Zong Ru showed little wariness.

Meanwhile, Silver Hair King behind her quickly became vigilant.

Filled with the Fighting Attribute, it sensed a dangerous aura emanating from the other.

"Do you want to eat my candied haw? Ru asked cheerfully, offering the treat in her hand, "Here, it’s for you."
