Chapter 692 - 335: You Have Such Nerve!_3

The other four vice presidents did not scramble to take on the task at this time.

After all, the responsibility conferred by President Starlight had always been handled by Qin Huaiyu.

Having Qin Huaiyu take care of this matter was also justifiable.

The chat group quickly fell into silence again, and Qin Huaiyu, humming a tune from an opera, briskly walked out of the office.

"The fish~is about~to bite~"

-----------------

"Hah~"

Xu Ran yawned, resting his chin on his hand while watching the crowd outside the shop.

As the time approached noon, the street in front of the shop became increasingly lively.

As a newly opened shop, Starfire Foster Care Shop attracted many curious passersby, but those passersby did not turn into customers.

Upon seeing the price menu, they left without hesitation.

Several hours after opening, apart from the first two customers, there had been no business at all.

"Chirp~" (Was it this difficult when opening other branches too?)

Twelve’s twelve claws grasped the decorative branch sticking out next to the counter, asking curiously.

"Meow~" (To even have two customers in the morning is quite good already.)

Ziyun lay lazily on the counter, not even bothering to lift its head, merely swaying its tail that was larger than its body.

"Yeah, every beginning is tough," Xu Ran said with a smile, "For any new shop without fame, it’s generally the same."

"Once the shop’s fame increases, we will start getting more and more customers."

"Chirp~" (Is that so...) Stay tuned for updates on empire

Twelve nodded thoughtfully, then sensing something, turned its gaze towards the shop’s doorway with a hint of anticipation in its eyes.

"Chirp!" (A new customer is coming!)

As Twelve finished speaking, four figures quickly stepped into the shop.

Xu Ran looked up, his gaze flickering slightly.

These four men were sturdy and carried a somewhat fierce aura; they seemed like tough customers, probably quite strong.

More importantly...

Xu Ran faintly felt some hostility emanating from these four men.

Nevertheless, he still stood up and greeted them with a smile, "Gentlemen, what services do you require?"

"What services does your shop offer?" the leader of the men asked in a deep voice.

"The price menu is just behind you," Xu Ran said, raising a hand to indicate.

The four men turned to look at the price menu, then exchanged glances with each other.

Immediately after, the man on the left snorted disdainfully and stepped forward with an unpleasant expression, slapping his hand on the counter, "Your prices are two to three times higher than elsewhere, it’s clear extortion!"

Looking at the man, the smile on Xu Ran’s face gradually faded.

Indeed, it seemed they had ill intentions.

"All the services offered by this shop are worth their price," he said calmly, "If you four have come to cause trouble, please leave."

"Leave?" Another man smirked, "I think you’re just embarrassed and enraged because you’ve been called out."

He strode toward the shop’s entrance, shouting loudly as he did, "Today, I’m going to let everyone see what a swindler the owner of this Black Shop is!"

[Three thousand more words, furiously typing away]

For some reason, seeing this guy instantly brought back those feelings from before.@@novelbin@@

"Tang, let’s get out of here," he tugged at Tang Mu, hurrying to leave the Starfire Foster Care Shop.

"Take care on your way out," Xu Ran watched with a cheerful expression as the first few customers left the new shop, then stretched lazily.

Twelve, hidden in the darkness, fluttered its wings and landed on Xu Ran’s shoulder, its sea-blue eyes brimming with mirth.

"Chirp~" (That Beast Master of the Refining Flame Monkey had his contract sensing open the whole time during the washing and protection~)

"Huh?!" Xu Ran blinked in surprise.

Because of his unique washing and protection techniques, pet beasts that came to Starfire Foster for grooming often made strange sounds.

Beast Masters at the General Level or above usually blocked the sharing of their senses during the grooming process to avoid embarrassing situations.

Was there really a Beast Master who was so bold as to keep the contractual sensing open throughout the entire process?!

"I think there are surveillance cameras in the shop..." Xu Ran smacked his forehead, suddenly remembering something, and began working at the counter.

Soon, the footage from the washing and protection room appeared before his eyes.

Watching Zhou Yong adopting odd postures in rhythm with his own washing and protection technique, Xu Ran’s expression grew increasingly amused.

This was really... boldness to the extreme.

Xuanxing City, Pingtian Foster Shop.

As the most recognized foster service provider in Xuanxing City, the shop was frequented by a large number of customers every day.

Every day, new foster care residents were admitted into Pingtian Foster Shop’s foster area, and residents whose fostering period had ended left the place.

Because business was so booming, Pingtian Foster even had to adopt a reservation system, using reasonable scheduling to stabilize the number of residents in the foster area.

Today, a situation not usually seen occurred inside Pingtian Foster Shop.

"Boss!" The employee responsible for foster reservations sought out Tan Shao, the owner of Pingtian Foster Shop, with an unsightly expression, "A customer who had a reservation to foster a pet beast today didn’t show up."

"Didn’t show up?" Tan Shao frowned and looked at the employee, "Did you confirm by calling them?"

"It’s been confirmed," the employee nodded, "And the reason for not showing up is that they chose to foster at another shop."

"We’ve been undercut..." Tan Shao’s frown deepened.

It was occasional for a reserved customer not to turn up.

Perhaps due to some other factor, the customer might change their mind about fostering, which was within reasonable bounds.
