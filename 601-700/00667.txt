Chapter 672 - 330 Thunder Dragon Vs Cancan, The True Mastermind_3

Gazing at the resplendent golden eyes that were close at hand yet untouchable, a heavy sense of dread suddenly weighed down on the Profound Thunder Dragon’s heart.

The next moment, a series of deep rumbling sounds abruptly emanated from the void around them.

"Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!!!"

As the deep rumbling noises continued unceasingly, the Mysterious Azure Thunder Dragon discovered in horror that everything around it was collapsing at an alarming rate. Experience new stories on empire

It suddenly felt an intense pain, signaling the shattering of its elemental body, bit by bit.

A great deal of Thunderforce spilled from the breaches in the Profound Thunder Dragon’s body, causing it to shrink smaller and smaller, until it could no longer sustain its elemental state and reverted back to its fleshy form.

Its body was covered in dripping Dragon Blood, as it despairingly watched the terrifying power that seemed to completely crush it, leaving it engulfed in darkness the next moment.

Under Cancan’s forceful grasp, the space binding the Mysterious Azure Thunder Dragon turned to dust in an instant, leaving behind only the twinkling Extinct Thunder Attraction and an unvanished bright purple Dragon Scale hanging in the air.

Four Stars skill, Violent Sun Level·Land of Destruction!

Profound Thunder Dragon, perished!

After delivering that final blow, Cancan’s massive body quickly receded in size, returning to its original kilometer-long body type.

Its face bore traces of weariness mixed with a sense of longing for more.

In the battle just now, for the first time, it had fully unleashed the power of the Heaven-Earth Law, which was different from the previous Jiezimixu; Cancan could choose which Attribute to strengthen while weakening another.

It chose to diminish its own Recovery.@@novelbin@@

This was also why it was able to keep up with the Mysterious Azure Thunder Dragon during their fight.

But the decrease in Recovery also meant that what would have been a stamina for prolonged combat was now less than even Ziyun’s.

Just a single burst of exertion had left it feeling drained, a sensation it had not experienced in a long time.

Fortunately, such a sacrifice was worthwhile.

When unleashing the full might of the Heaven-Earth Law combined with the Echoing of Earth Vein, Cancan’s power had soared terrifyingly close to the Overlord stage. Coupled with the Violent Sun Level Four Stars skill Land of Destruction, it obliterated the Mysterious Azure Thunder Dragon in an instant.

Bear in mind, this was a Beast King at the peak of Great Complement.

The last one to achieve a one-shot kill had been the Nightmare Beast King.

This meant that Cancan’s current strength was by no means inferior to its adversary.

The battle was over, and instinctively, a dull yellow glow surrounded Cancan as it, with its Recovery restored, began to replenish its spent power.

But the next moment, Xu Ran’s voice echoed in Cancan’s mind.

"Don’t use the Echoing of Earth Vein, take it slow."

"What?" (Is there still something amiss?)

Cancan’s golden irises flickered slightly, comprehending Xu Ran’s intent immediately, and the dull yellow glow began to fade away.

It lay on the ground, appearing normal as it drew in the surrounding Earth attribute Power at a slightly slower pace than usual to slowly fill its enormous expenditure.

At this rate, it would take at least ten minutes to recover to its peak condition.

But Cancan was not at all flustered.

It had already sensed faint traces of Starlight flickering around it, ready to connect itself with the stars at any moment.

Having completed its disguise perfectly, curiosity couldn’t help but bubble up in Cancan’s mind.

Looking at the situation, Xu Ran was about to outmaneuver someone again.

But who else was there to outmaneuver?

It couldn’t help but look towards the Dragon Scale not far away, left behind after the demise of the Mysterious Azure Thunder Dragon—a resource at the King Stage level.

If it was capable of producing resources, there was no doubt that the Mysterious Azure Thunder Dragon was thoroughly dead.

Could it be that there was another hidden hand behind the scenes?

In Cancan’s eyes, a flash of anticipation appeared and vanished.

How thrilling! It enjoyed this!

"The Extinct Thunder Attraction is ours now!" Xu Ran laughed heartily, leading the other three little ones swiftly towards the Extinct Thunder Attraction that had fallen back to the ground, then mimed the action of picking it up.

In the moment of bending down, a sharp glint passed fleetingly in Xu Ran’s eyes.

Next instant, Xu Ran’s body, holding the Extinct Thunder Attraction, suddenly flew back several steps.

A Thunderbolt silently struck the original position of the Extinct Thunder Attraction, instantly melting the surrounding earth and forming a small area of plasma.

If Xu Ran had still been there, it’s likely he would have been turned into plasma.

Seeing this, Xu Ran couldn’t help but wipe the cold sweat from his forehead, then turned to look towards a certain part of the void.

"Cunning humans."

A muffled voice echoed throughout Fallen Thunder Valley.

At the same time, the spot Xu Ran was gazing at slowly twisted, and a figure emerged from the void, seeming as if it had just arrived or perhaps had been there for quite a while.

It was a Giant Beast with the head of a lion and a body resembling an eagle, with a wingspan of forty meters. Each feather radiated with unparalleled electrical light, and its third eye on the forehead seemed to possess a soul-stirring power.

"The feeling is mutual," Xu Ran sighed lightly upon seeing the creature, his face showing no great surprise, "You’ve finally shown yourself."

The real entity eyeing the Extinct Thunder Attraction, indeed, had appeared.

Ziyun and Twelve both inhaled sharply at that moment.

Both of them had sensed a familiar power emanating from this being before them.

This Beast King turned out to be a rare Dual attribute Beast King, possessing both the Thunder and Super ability Attributes.

"You know me?"

The mysterious Giant Beast’s gaze held a flicker of human-like astonishment.

"Not at all," Xu Ran shook his head slightly.

In that instant, he had checked all the creatures mentioned on the adventure map, but none matched the being before him.
