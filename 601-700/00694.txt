Chapter 699 - 337: Ziyun Takes Action, Dawn Star Radiance! _2

Unlike ordinary valleys, the outer edges of this valley were lined with layers of complex terrain and rocky outcrops. But the interior, as a whole, was concave, resembling the bottom of a massive pot.

Under the night sky, the rocks within the valley emitted a faint glow as if containing the power of stars, and this luminosity grew more intense as one drew closer to the heart of the valley.

This was the place they were searching for—the Fallen Star Valley.

"Crack~" Standing on the outskirts of the valley, Xu Ran casually broke off a piece of rock to examine.

Unlike rocks from the outside world, this small piece occasionally twinkled with a faint light and had peculiar colorful patterns on it, almost like a special ore, making it look very attractive.@@novelbin@@

Cancan raised its paw to touch the rock, and then its expression turned somewhat surprised.

"Cha~" (This rock contains not only Earth attribute power but also other forces.)

"Xi Lu!" (It’s Star Power!)

Star uttered a neigh.

Within the rock, it sensed a power that felt familiar.

As a non-Earth attribute Pet Beast, this should not have been possible.

Everything was due to the Star Power contained within the stones; it was this faint hint of Star Power that evoked a sense of closeness.

"Xi Lu~" (Here, I can enhance the effect of the ’Prayer of Starry Night’ by more than thirty percent.)

Feeling the dense Star Power in the surroundings, Star’s voice grew excited.

No matter how many stars there are in the sky, where could they be more easily absorbed and utilized than the Star Power on the ground?

"Elder Qi Yuan once said that the formation of the Fallen Star Valley is related to a meteorite from beyond the skies," Xu Ran said while playing with the rock in his hand, smiling, "It must be the Star Power within the meteorite that was gradually absorbed by the surrounding rocks."

"Let’s go, let’s take a look inside." Xu Ran looked towards the deeper parts of the Fallen Star Valley, his eyes shining with brightness.

This is a great place.

The group of one man and five Pet Beasts quickly moved through the rocky outskirts of the Fallen Star Valley to enter the valley proper.

The terrain inside the valley sloped downward on all sides, leading directly to the deepest part of the valley.

These slopes, washed over by the long passage of time, were no longer smooth, taking on undulations and ravines that told of their ancient past. Yet the overall downward trend remained unchanged, like a giant cauldron embedded into the earth, channeling the light of the stars.

Upon stepping inside, Xu Ran’s expression grew more cautious.

For he could already sense the unfriendly gazes lurking in the shadows.

Unlike the outside of the valley, this place was already inhabited by Transcendent Beings.

"Swoosh——"

A sharp whooshing sound tore through the tranquil night, swiftly attacking the group.

It was a feather that struck a rock directly in front of Xu Ran, turning the rock into powder in an instant.

This was a threat as well as a warning.

But faced with this threat, Xu Ran was unconcerned.

He turned his head to look at Star, "How many?"

Star’s amethyst-like eyes had unknowingly become pitch-black, with black chains intertwined within, adding an air of mystery.

Three Star Skill, Halo Level·Night Inspection.

"Xi Lu~" (Hundreds, with the highest only at Leadership Stage.)

Star neighed, accurately reporting the number and strength of nearby creatures.

"Only Leadership Stage?" Xu Ran raised an eyebrow, "Twelve."

"Chirp~" (Leave it to me!)

Twelve spoke eagerly, then spread its wings and soared into the sky.

Its bright, sea-blue eyes gazed down below, shining like two glowing sapphires amidst the dark canvas of the night.

An invisible force radiated out from it as the center, sweeping through the surroundings instantly.

Along with the soft sounds of bodies falling to the ground and collapse, all living creatures hidden in the shadows were cast into slumber in an instant.

Three Star Skill, Waning Moon Level·Endless Sleep!

Ten, at General Level, could easily put a group of beings at the highest Leadership Stage to sleep for several hours. At this moment, this skill allowed the group, stealthy and undetected, to penetrate deeper without stirring the wildlife.

"Well done." Xu Ran praised as he caught Twelve returning to his hand, and then they continued onwards.

Batch after batch of Transcendent Beings were put to forced sleep by Twelve, as Xu Ran and the five Pet Beasts ventured deeper into the heart of Fallen Star Valley.

The starlight that twinkled under the night sky became more resplendent, and the Star Power grew richer.

The strength of the Transcendent Beings evolved from the previous Leadership Stage to the General Stage—against creatures of this caliber, Twelve could no longer keep them asleep for long.

Sensing intruders within the valley, powerful presences surged to the skies, hurtling towards the group at rapid speed. They soon appeared from all directions, sealing off all escape routes thoroughly.

The setting fell into an eerie silence, but beneath this quietude surged a torrent of murderous intent.

The Transcendent Beings entrenched here naturally harbored no good will towards the humans who had ventured into their territory.

"I am here for a piece of Dawn Star Radiance," Xu Ran said calmly, his voice steady even amidst the encirclement of creatures, "Give it to me, and I will leave immediately."

Under the veil of night, Xu Ran and his four Pet Beasts rode upon Star, lightning-fast, and quickly arrived at their destination.

Before them was a valley with strangely shaped contours.

Unlike ordinary valleys, the outer edges of this valley were lined with layers of complex terrain and rocky outcrops. But the interior, as a whole, was concave, resembling the bottom of a massive pot.

Under the night sky, the rocks within the valley emitted a faint glow as if containing the power of stars, and this luminosity grew more intense as one drew closer to the heart of the valley.
