Chapter 638 - 321 Fireflies And The Twelve_3

Why has the preparation for evolving into the Emperor Species already begun?

"Meow~" (Yeah~ I’ve already exchanged for the evolution path, and not only that, Star has exchanged as well.)

Ziyun licked its paw, speaking slowly and deliberately.

"Xi Lu~" (Indeed.)

The swiftly moving Star whinnied in affirmation of Ziyun’s words.

Emperor Species evolution path!

Twelve couldn’t help but swallow, its eyes becoming more brightly lit.

It really wanted it!@@novelbin@@

Sensing Twelve’s desires, Cancan gave it a wary glance.

"Chah!" (The next one is mine!)

It had been looking forward to this for a long time and wouldn’t let Twelve take the lead.

"Tweet~" (Alright, then I’ll take the one after the next.)

Twelve quickly calmed down, casually flapping its wings.

Since Xu Ran was able to get two in such a short time, then getting another two shouldn’t take too long.

It had only just evolved into the King Species; its next evolution surely wouldn’t come so soon.

And...

When it evolved, it owed Ziyun and Star quite a few things. When its time for the first resource allocation came, it would still have to repay that part.

Thinking of this, Twelve spoke with a touch of guilt.

"Tweet?" (Those items Ziyun and Star lent me today, were they expensive?)

"It’s fine." Xu Ran stroked his chin, "Two Three Star Skill Scrolls, 37 Skill Fusion Stones, and 240 Skill Fragments used for skill fusion. In total, that comes up to 8100 Value Points."

"I’ve opened quite a few branches recently, so there’s been an increase in resource earnings." Xu Ran said with a smile, "By the time of the next resource allocation, you should still have a small amount left after repaying your debt."

A small amount...

Twelve’s expression drooped.

That doesn’t sound good!

"Don’t be disheartened, you’re already doing much better than those three." Xu Ran patted Twelve’s head, "After all, Nightmare Senior provided the evolution materials."

"They spent quite a few Value Points for their evolution materials back then."

Hearing Xu Ran’s words, Ziyun, Star, and Cancan nodded together.

Ziyun in particular, because Xu Ran hadn’t been to Second Level Towns yet when it evolved, and those rare and hard-to-find Main Materials for Evolution were obtained by them through sheer luck.

Having heard what Xu Ran said, Twelve’s spirits immediately lifted.

"Tweet?" (Are we going to Xieyun City next? Or Monster Wooden City?)

Before, it had heard that after arriving at Beast Field 47, one human with three pets had opened a branch in Xieyun City, and Xu Ran’s conversation with the Nightmare Beast King revealed that there was also a branch in Monster Wooden City.

To Twelve, the places Xu Ran intended to visit could only be these two.

"No, it’s neither of the two." Xu Ran smiled, "We’re going to Bright Radiance City."

"...Tweet?" (Where’s that?)

Twelve looked puzzled.

A new branch again?

It had been only a little more than twenty days since they left, and it felt like it was struggling to keep up with the updates.

"Chah~" (Not just a new branch, there’s a new partner too!)

Cancan chuckled and couldn’t help but speak up.

What?

A new partner?

Twelve’s eyes grew even wider.

Was it no longer the youngest in the team?

Did it have a ’little brother’ now?

In an instant, its attention was entirely captivated by the prospect of an unknown new partner.

"Firefly is still on a probationary period." Xu Ran tapped Cancan’s head lightly and then looked at Twelve, "Once we get to Bright Radiance City, you’ll see."

"Xi Lu Lu~" (We are about to arrive at Qingzhou City.)

Star whinnied, looking at Qingzhou City, whose outline was now visible, and suddenly accelerated.

Soon after, one human with four pets passed through the city gate and entered the city. "Is the problem on our human side?"

Hearing the Nightmare Beast King’s words, a look of surprise appeared on Xu Ran’s face.

This was unexpected.

According to his thinking, humans were the weaker party in front of the Beast Field. Merely defending the city had already resulted in significant casualties. They should be the ones most eager for peace and thus should not have any reason to object to the proposal.

Therefore, as long as he could persuade the Nightmare Beast King, everything else should proceed smoothly.

But from what the Nightmare Beast King implied, was that not the case?

"It seems you are unaware of the situation with the other 3 Level towns within Beast Field 97." Reading Xu Ran’s confusion, the Nightmare Beast King guessed the truth and spoke slowly.

"Within Beast Field 97, there are a total of 7 3 Level towns. The strongest is Changshi City, which owns a King Level Beast Master. Each of the other six towns is presided over by a Beast Master at General Level."

The Nightmare Beast King paused for a moment, "Among the seven human Beast Masters in charge, four hold enormous hostility towards us Transcendent Beings."

"Their goal is to enslave the wild Transcendent Beings and turn the entire Beast Field 97 into human territory."

"This includes Changshi City."

"Under such circumstances, it is highly unlikely for them to agree to coexist peacefully with Transcendent Beings. Even if they do agree, they’d likely renege on their word behind the scenes." The Nightmare Beast King glanced at Xu Ran, "Unless..."

"Unless there is an absolute power that can dominate over them." Xu Ran caught on and continued.

"Yes." The Nightmare Beast King nodded slightly, "I am now stronger than before, but not enough to be considered dominating. We still need a stronger presence to rally the creatures of Beast Field 97 for such a change."

"The new order is built upon absolute strength." The Nightmare Beast King glanced at Xu Ran, "Your vision is beautiful, but to achieve it, you need to become stronger."
