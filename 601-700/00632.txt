Chapter 632 - 320: The Brand New Form Of Twelve!

[Content incomplete, will be supplemented during the day]

After a deep breath, Twelve’s gaze finally settled on the resources placed on the side of the high platform.

Each of these resources was pulsating with tremendous energy, any single one of them worth the sum of all the power within its body.

And now, it was about to devour these resources in one breath, absorbing their energy entirely as the driving force for its own evolution.

There was no doubt that this process was dangerous. A slight misstep could result in being burst by the overly powerful energy, dying on the spot.

But this was the ordeal all evolutions had to face.

Without hesitation, Twelve swallowed all the resources in one gulp.

Lastly, it drank up the drop of Blood Essence that originated from its father.

The Blood Essence, full of life and power, became the solvent for all, melting all the resources into one, also causing the conflicting energies to reach their most violent intensity in an instant.

Twelve’s sea-blue eyes filled with pain in that moment.

At this instant, it felt as if there were multiple forces fighting within its body, each battling on its own, completely indifferent to its life or death.

They mercilessly tore apart Twelve’s innards, causing its breath to weaken rapidly in a very short time.

Yet, as its breath weakened, the energy fluctuations around Twelve’s body surged wildly at an abnormal speed, a stark contrast that marked the beginning of the evolution going out of control.

"So soon?" Xu Ran was shocked, his expression turning tense quickly.

When the three little ones had evolved into the King Species before, they too had moments of life-and-death crisis, but that was after the evolution had progressed to a certain extent.

Had Twelve just started ingesting the resources and was already in such danger?

"This should be related to my blood," the Nightmare Beast King, who was on the side, seemed to realize something, his voice growing deep. "The evolution requires Blood Essence from the Superpower-tier King Level, but I am not an ordinary King Stage."

"My blood is stronger."

"But don’t worry too much," the Nightmare Beast King said, closely watching Twelve’s unusual state, and began to speak slowly. "The Blood Essence you humans obtain, often comes from a master who has long passed away, but I am still alive, and I am right here."

"This is my blood. How could I let it harm my daughter?" Pride shone in the eyes of the Nightmare Beast King. "Watch, even if Twelve evolves into a Sleeping Bird, she won’t be an ordinary Sleeping Bird."

As if in response to the words of the Nightmare Beast King, the raging powers that had consumed Twelve seemed to suddenly hit the pause button and quieted down.

Yet in Twelve’s own perception, the situation was entirely different.

The wild and chaotic powers within its body raged in separate battles, rending its flesh from the inside out, but as the Blood Essence carrying these powers made contact with Twelve’s wounds and its own blood, everything changed.

The Blood Essence, which had been inconspicuous before, seemed to awaken in this moment, exploding with a terrifyingly powerful force. Vaguely, one could even glimpse the figure of a colossal Demon Hawk flashing through the blood light.

And the soaring force was not aimed at Twelve.

It suppressed all the conflicting energies of the evolution resources in an extremely ruthless and unreasonable manner.

Like a father pressing down the head of a thug who was harming his daughter, holding him under the water, the dominant force melded all the other powers into the Blood Essence.

Evolution—an undeniably arduous process—is about gradually absorbing the disparate evolution materials and ultimately integrating their powers to transform them into one’s own.

However, the power hidden within the Blood Essence was now undertaking a similar act.

It shattered and blended the forces that had merged into the Blood Essence, bit by bit, and then infused the completed integrated portion, along with a part of the Blood Essence, into Twelve’s body.

Bit by bit.
