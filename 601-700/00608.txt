Chapter 608 - 314: Mutated Race, The Inextinguishable Fire!

Nature is the best teacher for all living creatures.

Wild Transcendent Beings, without anyone to guide them, can grasp various life and combat skills by relying on their own wisdom and trials.

And in the Green Bud Pet Beast Breeding Base, Song Xuan’s free-range attitude towards the pet beasts has allowed them to master some skills that are ordinarily hard to learn.

Even more precious than the skills themselves is the process they went through to achieve all this.

"Boss Xu, do you think... could it be that there’s something wrong with my training methods?" Song Xuan, completely unaware of what Xu Ran was thinking, spoke up with a touch of helplessness.@@novelbin@@

"Although I want them to live unrestrained, finding each their own home is also my wish."

"I don’t think there’s anything wrong with your training methods, it’s just... you might need to change the way you make more Beast Masters accept them," Xu Ran said with a smile, "not just for Washing and Protection at my place."

"What way?" Song Xuan asked, curiosity in her eyes.

"You need to make the Beast Masters who come to select understand that these seemingly abnormal behaviors of theirs all have their reasons," Xu Ran’s voice paused slightly, "You remember what I just said, right?"

"You mean..." Song Xuan’s eyes gradually lit up.

During the tour of the four Wind attribute pet beasts, Xu Ran had provided reasonable explanations for each of the beasts’ unusual behaviors.

If she could write these explanations down and inform the incoming Beast Masters using display boards or something similar, then they wouldn’t think the pet beasts’ behaviors were abnormal.

With that, they would naturally be more accepting of the beasts from the base!

"Boss Xu, please wait a moment!" Song Xuan hurried off. After a little while, she found some paper and a pen from somewhere and noted down all the reasons for the behaviors of the four pet beasts that Xu Ran had mentioned, even asking Xu Ran to confirm the parts she wasn’t clear about.

Looking at the densely packed words on the paper, Song Xuan’s face was full of an expectant smile, "Boss Xu, shall I take you to the next park for a visit?"

"No problem," Xu Ran chuckled.

Seeing these little guys, who were smarter than the average pet beasts, being disliked as "abnormal" was also distressing for Xu Ran; being able to help them find suitable Beast Masters faster was a good thing.

Leaving the Wind Attribute Park, the two immediately went to the adjacent Fire Attribute Park.

As soon as they entered, they were met with rolling heat waves.

"Meow~"

Curled up in Song Xuan’s arms, the green-striped cat meowed softly and twisted its body uneasily, clearly uncomfortable with the intense heat.

"Little guy, I’ll come find you in a bit." Song Xuan gently set it down and watched as it quickly ran back to the Wind Attribute Park before getting up to face Xu Ran, "In the Fire Attribute Park, there are a total of five Leader Species, but there are fewer individuals, only 26."

"These five species are the Flame Melting Turtle, Fire-tailed Bear, Fire-eating Ghost, Flame Heart Pig, and Nether Flame Wolf."

"Okay," Xu Ran nodded, his eyes showing a hint of anticipation.

Just like the four species in the Wind attribute area, the five species in the Fire attribute area were also among the top of the Leader Species, each possessing four two-star Talent Skills.

Xu Ran was very curious about what kind of unusual behavior they would display.

"Chah~" (Flame Melting Turtle, huh...) Cancan stretched out a claw, imitating Xu Ran by touching its chin, and pondered.

Could Xu Ran possibly contract a Flame Melting Turtle, allowing the turtle species to expand in his team? Oh, it’s a Dragon Turtle, never mind then.

"Let’s first take a look at the area where the Flame Melting Turtles are," Song Xuan smiled, taking the lead with paper and pen in hand, ready to take notes.

Soon, the two people and three beasts arrived at an artificial volcano crater scene.

As before, there were already several Beast Masters gathered in twos and threes, prepared to pick their pet beasts.

Seemingly sensing the newcomers in the park, a wave of heat swept over them, and from the bubbling lava of the volcano, several heads that resembled alligators emerged, their shells looking like little volcanoes.

On their sturdy shells, red lava continuously spewed out from the center, flowing towards the edges and finally solidifying into dark red rocks at the periphery.

The Flame Melting Turtles moved their bodies slowly, step by step approaching the crowd.

Despite their slow movements, their steady steps gave a sense of reliability and security one could trust.

As one of the few offensively and defensively capable species within the Fire attribute, Flame Melting Turtles were extremely popular.

Among the crowd, the eyes of many Beast Masters picking their pet beasts lit up.

At that moment, it seemed as if they were seeing their dream turtles.

However, the next moment, the Flame Melting Turtles simultaneously stopped in their tracks.

Their actions were uniform as they pressed their heads against the ground all at once.

Just as everyone wondered what they were going to do, the turtles’ sturdy limbs suddenly exerted force, flipping their originally steady shells over so that they stood upright like wheels.

Then, the Flame Melting Turtles retracted their limbs and heads into their shells. With their heads no longer supporting them on the ground, their round shells began rolling down the hillside towards the crowd like uncontrolled wheels.

Seeing this, the spectators’ expressions turned particularly interesting.
