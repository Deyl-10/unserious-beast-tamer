Chapter 606 - 313 Green Bud Pet Beast Breeding Base_3

Xu Ran nodded in understanding and followed Song Xuan toward the passage.

Just as they entered the passage, a small and agile pet beast dashed towards the two of them and then with a light leap, landed in Song Xuan’s arms.

It was only then that Xu Ran could see clearly that it was a green-spotted cat with a wind attribute.

The condition of the green-spotted cat was not very good, as it had several obvious wounds on its body. Although they were healing, it seemed to be undergoing decent treatment, but it had not fully recovered yet.

"Is the green-spotted cat one of the four wind attribute species at your breeding base?" Xu Ran asked casually.

"No," Song Xuan shook her head, "The four wind attribute species at our Pet Beast Breeding Base are the Windbreaker Eagle, Wind God Deer, Azure Heron Dragon, and Cloud Crossing Kite. This green-spotted cat just plays there occasionally, since the environment inside is very friendly to the wind attribute."

"This poor little guy has not been at the base for long, I’ve been taking care of it personally," Song Xuan said with a touch of compassion as she stroked its head, "Those four species are very amiable and won’t bully it."

"I see..." Xu Ran nodded slightly.

He was familiar with the four species Song Xuan mentioned.

Each of the four species was naturally equipped with four two stars skills, top-tier leader species, which wasn’t unusual in a Second Level Town.

After listening to Song Xuan, he became more interested in the green-spotted cat in her arms, "Does this little fellow also need washing and protection?"

"It is still recovering from its injuries, I’m not sure if it can..."

"It can," Xu Ran replied affirmatively, "Not only that, but incorporating some resources to help with healing during the washing and protection process can also speed up its recovery."

"Then let’s do the washing and protection together!" Song Xuan said without hesitation.

And the green-spotted cat seemed to understand their conversation, poking its head out and meowed at Xu Ran to express its thanks.

"So, why did this green-spotted cat get injured?" Xu Ran couldn’t help but curiously inquire.

From Song Xuan’s words, he could infer that the injury to the green-spotted cat was definitely not caused by Song Xuan.

"That..." Song Xuan’s voice paused for a moment, a trace of dissatisfaction in her eyes, "It’s the neighboring Wind and Cloud Pet Beast Breeding Base."

"I found this green-spotted cat by chance at their base."

"... Ah?" Xu Ran blinked, "You run a breeding base, do you need to buy pet beasts from other breeding bases?"

"It’s not like that..." Song Xuan shook her head, "The Wind and Cloud Base, they breed a group of Fierce Wind Apes. To cultivate their wild nature, they threw this green-spotted cat into their habitat, making it an object for the Fierce Wind Apes to bully."

"Is that so?" Xu Ran was somewhat taken aback.

"After all, Fierce Wind Apes are expensive, while green-spotted cats are cheap," Song Xuan spoke with a deeper meaning, her eyes filled with disgust and disdain.

On hearing this, Xu Ran’s expression turned somewhat unsightly.

The Fierce Wind Apes were a combative and brutal pet beast species. Although they lived in groups, they were not cohesive; the stronger members of the tribe found joy in oppressing the weaker ones.

He also understood the implication in Song Xuan’s words.

Fierce Wind Apes that were bullied for a long time by their own kind would certainly not be saleable as pet beasts, as both their physical and mental states would have issues.

This would be a significant loss for a Pet Beast Breeding Base.@@novelbin@@

To prevent this, they add an individual that everyone in the group can bully to the Fierce Wind Apes’ community.

As a result, there would be no Fierce Wind Apes suppressed to the point of being unsaleable.

The green-spotted cat had become this unlucky individual.

"I couldn’t stand it and bought the green-spotted cat," Song Xuan’s eyes dimmed, "But I’m afraid that within that group of Fierce Wind Apes, there’s already a new victim."

"Such behavior is indeed excessive," Xu Ran spoke gravely, "Are there no regulations against such actions by breeding bases?"

"The Association hasn’t made any such demands, and since the Wind and Cloud Base is privately owned, the person in charge has the final say in many matters," Song Xuan said, shaking her head slightly as she gently stroked the green-spotted cat in her arms, "Let’s not talk about this, I’ll take you to see the Windbreaker Eagle instead."

-----------------

With the misunderstanding cleared up, Xu Ran picked up Ziyun and Cancan, mounted Star, and quickly set off from the shop.

Green Bud Pet Beast Breeding Base was not unknown within Bright Radiance City.

After casually asking a few passersby, Xu Ran quickly made his way to the specific location, following the navigation without delay.

Looking at the large gate of the base with the sign "Green Bud Pet Beast Breeding Base" in big characters, embellished with green bud patterns hanging high, Xu Ran nodded slightly.

It did appear to be reputable.

Beast Masters continuously entered the base entrance. Some appeared very young, with their parents accompanying them, their faces filled with excitement; presumably, these were prospective Beast Masters about to contract their very first pet beast.

With so many people entering the base, Green Bud Pet Beast Breeding Base’s business should be flourishing.

However, Xu Ran shook his head slightly at the situation at the other gate of the base.

Every person leaving the base was unaccompanied by a pet beast.

Such a situation probably indicated some issues with the operation of Green Bud Pet Beast Breeding Base.

With no interest in critiquing someone else’s business, Xu Ran’s visit was solely to inspect the actual conditions of the pet beasts within the breeding base.

After a brief observation, he approached the entrance, took his place at the end of the queue, and waited to enter.
