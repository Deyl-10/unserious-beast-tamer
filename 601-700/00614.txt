Chapter 614 - 315: The First Resident Of The Foster Area_3

```

Hearing this, Ziyun, who was whispering to the other three little ones, suddenly made a somewhat strange expression.

One really had to wonder how the person who almost named it "Electra" could ever think they had a high level of naming skill...

"It’s getting late, and I have to open for business this afternoon, so I’ll take my leave first." Feeling the faint disdain from Ziyun behind him, Xu Ran laughed it off and quickly bid farewell to Song Xuan.

"Star!"

"Xi Lu Lu~" (Yes!)

Star neighed, and its body, which had shrunk to better communicate with No. 6, quickly grew a few inches.

It lifted its front hooves and took two steps forward, moving up beside Xu Ran to be prepared for riding.

"Lu Hou?" (What’s this?)

Watching Star’s movements, No. 6 could not help but blink its eyes.

It was not surprised that Star could grow larger; after all, it had shrunken in front of it earlier. Enjoy exclusive content from NovelBin.Côm

But No. 6, having just merged into the group of one person with three little Pet Beasts, was still a bit clueless about what was to come next.

"Chah~" (We’re going home!)

Cancan, who had quickly become familiar with No. 6, was the second to warm up to it; it now reached out a paw and patted No. 6’s shoulder, speaking excitedly.

Going home?@@novelbin@@

No. 6 paused for a moment and then there was a strong look of anticipation in its eyes. "The feathers at the very end of the Raw Thunder Owl’s wings are composed of Thunder elements. Such energy-state feathers can automatically repair themselves after abrasion and help them fly faster."

"But the disadvantage is also apparent, and that is, the energy-state feathers cannot sensitively perceive the direction of the wind. This lack of subtle perception robs the Raw Thunder Owl of flexibility in flying despite its speed."

"The Raw Thunder Owls at the base keep turning during flight to train this flexibility and compensate for this inherent shortcoming."

"I understand now." Song Xuan quickly noted down Xu Ran’s explanation and smiled with relief a moment later, "I’ve finished observing the last species."

"Mhm." Xu Ran nodded.

Having reviewed all of the Pet Beasts at the Green Bud Pet Beast Breeding Base, Xu Ran now had an initial estimate of the condition of these hundred-plus Pet Beasts requiring Washing and Protection.

Thanks to Song Xuan’s unique free-ranging breeding method, these Pet Beasts had figured out quite a few small tricks to help maintain their condition.

Although they had not previously undergone Washing and Protection, each one of them was still in pretty good shape, with only a very few requiring Washing and Protection above Four Stars.

This meant that the workload for Washing and Protection would be accordingly lighter.

"The few Pet Beasts I pointed out earlier, bring them to my Foster Shop for Washing and Protection in a couple of days," Xu Ran instructed, "I will set aside time specifically to wash and protect the rest later."

The ones above Four Stars had relatively urgent Washing and Protection requirements, and as their numbers were few, early Washing and Protection would not delay the increase in Fame, something Xu Ran had already pointed out during his inspection.

"No problem." Song Xuan nodded without hesitation, raised the notebook in her hand, and showed a grateful expression, "And thank you for sharing all this knowledge with me today; I believe it will greatly improve everyone’s perception of the Pet Beasts at the base."

"I just hope that these excellent Pet Beasts can find suitable Beast Masters as soon as possible," Xu Ran said, pausing slightly as he turned to look at the little one following closely behind him, its body covered in flames-colored fur, "Besides, you’ve already given me a thank you gift."

After leaving the Fire-tailed Bear’s living area, No. 6, who had decided to follow Xu Ran, joined the visiting group, following Xu Ran just as the three little ones did.

At first, it felt a bit unfamiliar with Cancan and Ziyun, but this feeling vanished quickly as the three constantly talked with it.

It had also somewhat integrated with the group.

"No. 6 is lucky to be able to follow you," Song Xuan smiled and then reminded, "But Boss Xu, ’No. 6’ is just a code name. When you take it back, you can give it a nicer name."

"Don’t worry." Xu Ran nodded seriously, "I’m very good at naming."

Hearing this, Ziyun, who was whispering with the other three little ones, suddenly wore a somewhat strange expression again.

One really had to wonder how the person who almost named it "Electra" could ever think they had a high level of naming skill...

"It’s getting late, and I have to open for business this afternoon, so I’ll take my leave first." Feeling the faint disdain from Ziyun behind him, Xu Ran laughed it off and quickly bid farewell to Song Xuan.
