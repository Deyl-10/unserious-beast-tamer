Chapter 623 - 317: The Doubtful Nightmare Beast King_4

The Nightmare Beast King spoke in a deep voice, his originally somewhat favorable impression of Xu Ran plummeting at this moment.

Twelve, who had been somewhat vague and did not want to let her father king know the exact situation, felt discontented the moment she heard his words.

"Chirp!" (Xu Ran is not a liar!)

Looking at Twelve’s stubborn eyes, the Nightmare Beast King sighed inwardly.

"Screech~" (He’s just a young man from a 3 Level town, he probably only has a partial understanding of evolution, how could he possibly grasp such an evolution path?)

"Chirp!" (But Ziyun, Star, and Cancan all successfully evolved following the evolution path he gave!)

"Screech?" (You’re talking about his three Pet Beasts?)

Upon hearing this, the Nightmare Beast King was slightly taken aback.

After being reminded by Twelve, it vaguely remembered that indeed, the three Pet Beasts of the human had completed their evolution when it saw them before.

This was also relatively rare in a 3 Level town.

Could it be that this human really did have some evolution paths, including one for the Velvet Sparrow?

At this moment, the Nightmare Beast King’s initial skepticism was slightly shaken.

However, it quickly seemed to recall something and shook its head again.

"Screech~" (They might be Pet Beast Species whose evolution paths have already been mastered by humans, but the Velvet Sparrow is not among them.)@@novelbin@@

The Nightmare Beast King, who had traveled through a Beast Emperor-level Beast Field, had seen the scale of a Second Level Town.

It knew that compared to the relatively weak Beast Fields like number 97, where a Beast King could bring about destruction to human cities, Second Level Towns were nearly immoveable.

There, more powerful Beast Masters resided, and also there were things that 3 Level towns did not possess.

These were some of the Pet Beast evolution paths that humans had mastered through generations of attempts.

With these evolution paths, strong Beast Masters frequently emerged in Second Level Towns.

And the Nightmare Beast King, in its quest to find and complete the evolution path for the Velvet Sparrow race, had not overlooked the evolution paths mastered by humans.

It relied on ambushing human Beast Masters, using Super ability Attribute means to search their memories, and could basically be certain that humans had not yet mastered the evolution path of the Velvet Sparrow.

Even if there was one, it was at best a crude and weak evolution path.

Xu Ran’s ability to successfully evolve three Pet Beasts was special in Beast Field number 97, but in a Second Level Town, it was nothing out of the ordinary.

If he found a way to make contact with a Second Level Town, he might well be able to achieve it.

Therefore, this did not provide much persuasive evidence that he possessed a stronger evolutionary form for the Velvet Sparrow.

Looking at his daughter’s still stubborn gaze, the Nightmare Beast King steadied his mind.

"Screech~" (Concerning the evolution path that human boy gave you, is there any more specific content?)

His daughter was searching for resources, which indicated that the human had at least given her some information.

It wanted to judge the truth of this evolution path in order to completely disillusion his daughter.

For other wild Transcendent Beings, this might be difficult, but for the Nightmare Beast King, it was not a challenge.

Because, it had once attempted to break through to the Emperor Species.

Although it ultimately failed, in the process of trying to reach that completely new Life Level, it still captured some whispering voices.

This is the biggest Secret hidden behind wild Transcendent Beings.

In each process of evolution, they would capture strange murmuring whispers, filled with messy and vast information about the ultimate secrets of life evolution.

If they could by any chance capture a hint related to their own species’ Secret, they would have a chance to soar to the skies.

Although there were no bonds or rules, the thought of burying this Secret deep within their hearts, never to let other creatures know, was branded into their minds like a steel stamp at the moment they first heard those chaotic whispers.

And such whispers, in the evolution of a Pet Beast, would not occur.

The Nightmare Beast King’s breakthrough had failed, but its luck was surprisingly good, catching a hint of a secret that was intimately related to the essence of evolution.

This gave it an incredibly deep understanding of evolution.

As long as Twelve could provide more specific information, it could easily find contradictions and errors within the evolution path, thereby proving that these were just nonsense spouted by that human boy.

Seeing his father still full of disbelief, Twelve’s stubborn temper flared up.

Since it had already led its father to deduce the true nature of the facts, why not simply show that the Beast Master he chose was extraordinary!

"Chirp!" (This evolution path is…)

Without much hesitation, Twelve blurted out the evolution path content for the Velvet Sparrow to evolve into the Sleeping bird.

As Twelve’s words ended, an eerie silence fell over the scene.

The Nightmare Beast King’s expression showed a noticeable change for the first time.

This evolution path seemed so absurd to it.

Having a Leader Species upgrade all skills to Three Stars before evolution was like a fool’s dream.

From the mysterious whisper it had learned from, only the Holy Spirit Race could upgrade Four Stars skills to Five Stars.

And that wasn’t just a pure upgrade, but an integration of all Talent Skills into the Wheel of Life, fundamentally different.

Upgrading skills is a feature of evolution, so how could it be completed before evolution?

But just as the Nightmare Beast King was about to refute this evolution path and tell its daughter that this evolution plan was definitely flawed, it fell silent once again.

Because aside from that one point, this evolution path was so flawless in every other aspect that it even seemed perfect, astonishing the Beast King.

Whether it was the pairing of evolution materials or the setting up of the evolution ritual, everything felt impeccably arranged.
