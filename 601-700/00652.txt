Chapter 652: Chapter 325: An Examination Of The Firefly

[Content to be added]

"So, which skill do you plan to enhance to Violent Sun Level?"

After upgrading Star's second Talent Skill to Four Stars, Xu Ran asked.

"Xi Lu~" (Prayer of Starry Night, I guess.)

Star didn't hesitate much and quickly gave an answer.

Although the recently promoted Four Stars Star Oath was equally important, bringing Prayer of Starry Night up to Violent Sun Level would yield more enhancements.

"Good," Xu Ran nodded slightly.

Moments later, on Star's panel, the skill progress and point addition icons behind Prayer of Starry Night disappeared, leaving only the conspicuously large letters of [★★★★Prayer of Starry Night (Violent Sun Level)].

With that, Star's distribution of resources came to a conclusion.

Xu Ran's gaze shifted to Cancan and Twelve, who were waiting aside.

"Cha~" (I'll pass.)

Cancan shook its head.

During the recent resource distribution, it had only hoarded some Skill Fragments. After witnessing the repeated changes to Ziyun and Star's Skill Fusion plans, it deeply understood how plans can't keep up with changes and decided to just leave them untouched.

"Jiu~" (My Bewildered Heart Branding!)

Twelve flapped its wings, eyes filled with anticipation.

Upon seeing the skill, it instantly thought of the excellent synergy with Lead Silk Vertical Soul and decisively switched to this skill.

This was one of its few gains during this round of resource distribution.

"Good." Xu Ran smiled and nodded, promptly teaching out this skill that had been reserved for Twelve in advance.

The resource distribution for the four little ones was now complete.

After tallying the remaining resources and the Value Points of the four little ones, Xu Ran put down the chalk in his hand.

However, his eyes were still fixed on the blackboard.

Because there was still one resource on the blackboard that hadn't been exchanged.

It was a King Species Evolution Route.

At this moment, all four little ones could no longer make use of it.

But if the system had it in the Lottery Drawing, it would not be without reason.

After a brief silence, Xu Ran suddenly spoke, "What are your opinions about Firefly?"

"Meow?" (Firefly?)

Ziyun blinked.

"That's right," Xu Ran nodded, "Counting the time, Firefly has already been with us for half a month. What do you think? Is it suitable to become our new companion?"

Upon comprehending Xu Ran's question, the four little ones looked at each other, their expressions a bit more serious.

It concerned their future partner; they had to be cautious.

After some thought, Star was the first to speak.

"Xi Lu~" (I think it's quite nice but sometimes lacks self-confidence.)

It quickly recalled a recent incident and shared it with the others.

Business at Starfire Foster Care Shop was getting on track, and increasing numbers of residents were in the Foster area, including an Elite Stage Fire-tailed Bear. After seeing Firefly, it mercilessly mocked Firefly.

Perhaps because of past psychological shadows, Firefly was especially quiet when facing the Fire-tailed Bear, enduring the mockery without retort and later brooding for quite some time before recovering.

And this was why Star thought Firefly lacked confidence.

"Meow~" (I actually think it's quite confident, just a bit reckless.)@@novelbin@@

Ziyun countered, its dichromatic eyes gleaming amusedly as if it had remembered something.

There was a time when a King Stage new resident came to the Foster area. As Ziyun needed to defeat a King Stage to evolve, it sought a sparring match with the newcomer.

To their surprise, their bout was mistaken by Firefly, who thought Ziyun was being bullied and charged in with a yell, forgetting it was merely a Transcendent Stage little Karami.

"Cha~" (The bird eggs roasted by Firefly are really delicious!)

Cancan said earnestly.

One day, it brought some unknown bird eggs found by the group outside the city to Firefly, who instantly roasted them.

The roasted eggs turned out to be incredibly tasty, a flavor Cancan still vividly remembered.

Twelve gave Cancan an annoyed glare, then voiced its thoughts.

"Jiu~" (I think it's quite fun.)

Over the past half-month, Twelve had often used illusions to tease Firefly. Firefly fell for them every time without getting angry and even persistently pestered Twelve to keep playing.

As each of the four little ones chimed in one after another, a clearer picture of Firefly emerged.

And in Xu Ran's heart, an answer gradually formed.

"In that case, let's go and conduct a final assessment of it now," Xu Ran stood up, "If it passes the assessment, then this King Species Evolution Route will be our gift to it."

"Jiu?" (Assessment?)

Twelve cocked its head, looking puzzled.

It didn't remember such a procedure when it joined the team.

Twelve couldn't help but turn its head towards Cancan, hoping for an explanation.

However, Cancan was just as bewildered as Twelve.

After all, it was hatched and contracted by Xu Ran from the start, so there was no talk of any assessment.

Star thought for a moment then turned its gaze to Ziyun.

It didn't remember going through such a step either.

"Meow~" (Why are you all looking at me?)

Ziyun spread its paws.

It didn't know either...

"Stop looking at each other, this is a new idea I had recently," Xu Ran smiled, "Now that our little companions have grown in number, the requirements for new ones need to be stricter."
