"Is the problem on our human side?"

Upon hearing the Nightmare Beast King’s words, Xu Ran’s face revealed a hint of surprise.

This was something he hadn’t predicted.

According to his thoughts, humans were the weaker party in front of the Beast Field, merely defending the city had already resulted in no small number of casualties, they should be the ones most desiring peace and should not have any reason to oppose this proposal.

Therefore, he just needed to convince the Nightmare Beast King, and everything would naturally proceed smoothly.

Hearing the Nightmare Beast King’s implication, could it be that it was not so?

"It seems you are unaware of the situation in the other 3 Level towns within 97th Beast Field," the Nightmare Beast King guessed the reality based on Xu Ran’s puzzled expression and slowly started speaking.

"Within the 97th Beast Field, there are a total of 7 3 Level towns, among which the strongest is Changshi City, where there is a King Level Beast Master, and the most powerful Beast Master seated in the remaining six towns are at General Level."

The Nightmare Beast King paused for a moment, "Among the seven human Beast Masters seated in these towns, four hold extreme animosity towards us Transcendent Beings."

"Their goal is to enslave the wild Transcendent Beings and turn the entire 97th Beast Field into human territory."

"This includes Changshi City."

"Under such circumstances, it is difficult for them to agree to coexist peacefully with Transcendent Beings, and even if they agree, it is likely they will have ulterior motives." The Nightmare Beast King glanced at Xu Ran, "Unless..."

"Unless there is an absolutely powerful being who can dominate them," Xu Ran took over the conversation with understanding.

"Yes." The Nightmare Beast King nodded slightly, "I am stronger now than before, but not yet dominant. We still need an even more powerful being to successfully call upon the creatures of the 97th Beast Field to make such a change."@@novelbin@@

"A new order is established upon absolute strength," the Nightmare Beast King looked at Xu Ran, "The blueprint you’ve described is very beautiful, but to realize it, you need to become stronger."

"I understand," Xu Ran nodded slightly.

Similar words had been said by the Semi-Saint of Demon Wood as well.

In the end, if he wanted to turn the 97th Beast Field into a Holy Land like the Monster Wooden Domain, he still needed to be powerful enough himself.

"Since that’s the case, senior, I shall take my leave for now. I’ll come to find you when my strength is sufficient," Xu Ran bowed slightly to the Nightmare Beast King and turned to leave.

"Go ahead." The Nightmare Beast King opened one wing slightly and gave a soft pat to Twelve, pushing it in Xu Ran’s direction, then flapped its wings and disappeared into the sky.

"Chirp~" (Daddy!)

Twelve’s eyes were filled with reluctance, and only after the Nightmare Beast King’s figure could no longer be seen did it flap its wings and quickly follow Xu Ran.

It lightly landed on Xu Ran’s shoulder and looked at Ziyun in his arms.

From now on, it would no longer need to compete with Ziyun for a spot.

"Meow~"

Ziyun stretched lazily and contentedly closed its eyes.

Xu Ran’s embrace could only belong to it!

"I didn’t expect the goal to be achieved so smoothly," feeling the Star’s lightning-fast speed, Xu Ran turned his head to look at Twelve on his shoulder, "Originally, we had planned to steal you back after Ziyun evolved into the Emperor Species."

"Chirp~" (So that’s how it was~)

Twelve suddenly understood.

It seemed that it had exposed its Evolution Path, leading its "dad" to go directly to Qingzhou City to find Xu Ran, which had expedited everything.

Otherwise, it would have had to wait until Ziyun evolved into the Emperor Species before it could...

Wait a minute...

"Chirp?!" (Emperor Species?!)

Twelve stared at Ziyun, dumbfounded.

It hadn’t been separated from its companion for long, had it?

How had it already started preparing to evolve into the Emperor Species?

"Meow~" (Yeah~ I’ve already exchanged for the Evolution Path, and not just that, Star has exchanged as well.)

Ziyun licked its paw and began to speak unhurriedly.

"Xi Lu~" (Yes.)

The Star, racing through the air, let out a whinny, affirming Ziyun’s words.

Emperor Species Evolution Path!

Twelve swallowed reflexively, its eyes shining even brighter with desire.

It wanted one so badly!

But sensing Twelve’s thoughts, Cancan looked at it warily.

"Cha!" (The next one is mine!)

It had been looking forward to it for a long time, and it couldn’t let Twelve get ahead of it.

"Chirp~" (Alright, then I’ll take the one after the next.)

Twelve quickly calmed down, casually flapping its wings.

Since Xu Ran managed to get two in such a short time, getting another two shouldn’t take too long.

It had just evolved into the King Species, so its next evolution surely wouldn’t be so soon.

And...

During the evolution it owed Ziyun and the Star quite a lot, so when its first share of resource allocation arrived, it would have to repay that part.

Thinking of this, Twelve spoke somewhat sheepishly.

"Chirp?" (The things Ziyun and Star lent me today, are they expensive?)

"They’re okay," Xu Ran touched his chin, "Two Three Star Skill Scrolls, 37 Skill Fusion Stones, and 240 Skill Fragments used for Skill Fusion, in total adding up to 8,100 Value Points."

"I’ve opened quite a few branches recently, so I have a lot more resources," Xu Ran said with a chuckle, "By the next resource distribution, you should still have about half left after paying off your debts."

About half...

Twelve’s expression drooped.

That doesn’t sound very promising!

"Don’t lose heart, compared to the other three you’re already much better off," Xu Ran patted Twelve’s head, "After all, the evolution materials were provided by senior Nightmare."
