Chapter 660 Chapter 327: Fang Canghai’S Purpose And The Upper Realm’S Scrutiny

"Cha!" (King Stage, I have arrived!)

Cancan let out a lofty cry of triumph and then decisively stepped out of the shackles that had already loosened.

Its momentum climbed step by step, surpassing the General Stage in an exceedingly short time and reaching an even higher realm.

Vast Earth attribute Power swirled around Cancan; the outline of its body began to blur, as if with the enhancement of strength, its body naturally wanted to expand but was controlled by Cancan to shrink back to its original size.

Eventually, Cancan’s aura stabilized once more.

Although it seemed no different from before on the surface, there was already a significant change in its presence; the faint aura that emerged carried the majesty of a monarch.

King Stage!

Feeling its current strength, Cancan’s bright golden eyes were filled with excitement.

At this moment, it felt like it could take on ten Beast Kings!

Seeing that Cancan’s stats had increased more than fourfold from before, Xu Ran nodded slightly.

With such strength, they now had a trump card to compete openly with other powerful entities hiding in shadows for the Extinct Thunder Attraction.

"Meow~" (Let’s have Cancan be the strongest in our team for a while.)

Seeing Cancan’s strength had far surpassed her own after its advancement, Ziyun’s face showed a hint of competitive spirit.

The position of the strongest in the team was only temporarily conceded!

Once she evolved and successfully broke through to the King Stage, she would regain the title of the strongest in the team!

"After the points are settled, we’ll head back to Bright Radiance City," Xu Ran said with a silent smile, looking at Ziyun’s competitive demeanor, before speaking softly.

All four little ones responded in unison, revealing their anticipation.

The rewards from the Beast Trainer Ranking at the General Level were already ten times that of the Leadership Stage, and the points they had earned from today’s onslaught on the rankings were significant. Once these rewards were credited, they could exchange them for numerous resources.

Just as one man and four beasts were indulging in their fantasies, a soft knock came from outside the door, and the voice of the Fishing Old Man soon followed from outside.

"Boss, there’s someone here to see you."

"To see me?" Surprised appeared on Xu Ran’s face as he quickly stood up, made a gesture to the four little ones, and then opened the door.

The four little ones followed closely behind Xu Ran as they all stepped out of the room.

The next moment, they saw the visitor standing behind the Fishing Old Man. Enjoy exclusive adventures from empire

"Fang Yuling? Long time no see," Xu Ran greeted with a smile upon seeing the familiar face, but he quickly realized something and turned his head toward the calm and composed middle-aged man standing in front of Fang Yuling, "Are you... Chairman Fang?"

"It’s me," Fang Canghai nodded slightly, gazing intently at Xu Ran, "I never expected that Xieyun City would have a Beast Master prodigy like you."

"I am far from being a prodigy, just a bit luckier than others," Xu Ran responded modestly, which was also true to some extent.

However, such a response seemed too understated in the eyes of the Fang father and daughter.

Fang Yuling’s lips twitched involuntarily.

If this guy in front of her wasn’t considered a prodigy, then what was she?

After a pause, Fang Canghai also couldn’t help but laugh heartily.

"Good lad," Fang Canghai regarded Xu Ran with an appreciative look, "I wanted to invite you to represent Xieyun City in the exchange battle taking place in half a month, but it seems I’m a step too late."

"The exchange battle..." Xu Ran patted his forehead, only then remembering such an event.

But missing this exchange battle did not cause him any regrets, for his breakthrough to the fifth stage was essential to increase Ziyun’s chances of acquiring the Extinct Thunder Attraction.

"Chairman Fang, I have a question," looking at Fang Canghai up close, Xu Ran suddenly spoke up, "You seem really keen on uniting the human cities in Beast Field 47 and even beyond. Why is that?"@@novelbin@@

This question had long been on Xu Ran’s mind.

The first time he left Qingzhou City for Xieyun City and engaged in exchanges with young Beast Masters from other cities, it was for this purpose.

The upcoming exchange battle was also driven by this aim.

Why exactly was Chairman Fang so persistent about this matter?

"You want to know?" Hearing Xu Ran’s question, Fang Canghai’s eyes flashed, then he smiled faintly, "Actually, it’s not that complicated."

"If I’m not mistaken, you were also in the Monster Wooden Domain when the Demon Wood Half-Saint evolved," Fang Canghai continued.

"Yes," Xu Ran nodded slightly.

Fang Yuling looked at Xu Ran in surprise and then appeared to realize something, a look of enlightenment crossing her face.

At that time, Fang Yuling and Fang Canghai had first sought out Xu Ran, who had just left Xieyun City, and they had not encountered each other.

At that time, Xu Ran was on his way to Monster Wooden City.

Shortly after Xu Ran’s arrival at Monster Wooden City, the Monster Wooden Domain experienced such a world-shaking upheaval.
