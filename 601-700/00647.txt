Chapter 647 - 323 Psychiatrist Twelve_4

```

Three Star Skill, Halo Level·Flawless Illusion Realm.

Looking at its masterpiece, Twelve nodded in satisfaction, flapping its wings again as its consciousness returned to reality.

It called out to the girl lying on the sofa who was lost in her dream, her lips slightly upturned, and the next moment, Zong Ru, immersed in Endless Sleep, was awakened.

The girl sat up somewhat bewildered, but her eyes quickly became clear.

She looked around frantically, as if searching for something, and when her gaze fell on the Silver Hair King hiding behind her father, she froze.

The next instant, she screamed and jumped up, and under the stunned gaze of Mr. and Mrs. Zong, she rushed to the Silver Hair King and stretched out her tiny body as much as she could, hugging it tightly.

The Silver Hair King stood frozen, its eyes, so similar to those of humans, filled with shock and disbelief.

Its body trembled violently, and its large hands cautiously touched Zong Ru, then gently encircled her petite frame.

It had been too long since it had felt such a warm and familiar embrace.

Mrs. Zong’s eyes instantly reddened as she watched the large and small figures embrace, tears streaming down her cheeks.

Even Zong Hua couldn’t resist wiping his moistened eyes.

Before that incident, Zong Ru was the one who loved the Silver Hair King the most in the family, and they were almost inseparable.

But after that incident, everything changed.

Now, seeing a scene they had not seen for a long time, their emotions were beyond words.

"Chirp~" (I’m awesome, aren’t I.)

Twelve, having completed the task, flew onto Xu Ran’s shoulder, its face full of expectation for praise.

"You did a great job," Xu Ran said seriously as he stroked Twelve’s head. "Knock knock knock~"

Along with a series of slightly dull knocks, the door was quickly opened from the inside.

The door was opened by a girl who looked about seven or eight years old, wearing a cute princess dress as if she were ready to go out and play.

"Daddy!" The girl’s face immediately lit up with joy upon seeing Zong Hua outside the door, rushing towards him. However, when she noticed the somewhat evasive figure behind Zong Hua, her face turned pale.

As if the terrifying scene from half a year ago had flashed in her mind again, the girl screamed and quickly backed away.

Upon hearing the commotion, Mrs. Zong hurried over and held the girl soothingly while patting her back. After seeing the Silver Hair King, her face grew displeased, "Husband?"

"I’ve decided to let the Silver Hair King move back in with us," Zong Hua stated seriously as he walked into the house, "It’s not been happy outside, and it did nothing wrong in that incident. If it weren’t for him, Ru might not have survived."

"I know, but Ru is scared, and she’ll keep having nightmares with the Silver Hair King at home," Mrs. Zong replied helplessly.

"Let my Pet Beast help with that," Xu Ran, who followed Zong Hua into the Zong Family home, said with a smile.

"Who are you?" Mrs. Zong finally noticed Xu Ran, who had entered the house with her husband.

"This is Xu Ran, the owner of the Foster Shop where the Silver Hair King is staying," Zong Hua introduced, "He has a Pet Beast that can help Ru."

"If you don’t mind, please let me try," Xu Ran said softly, touching Twelve, which was perched on his shoulder.

"This…" Mrs. Zong couldn’t help but look at Zong Hua, and after a moment of eye contact, she slowly released her daughter from her embrace, "Thank you."

Zong Ru, sobbing, also heard the conversation, wiped her tears, and stood up slowly.

The next moment, she walked to the sofa on her own, lay down, and closed her eyes, quickly falling into a dream state.

Twelve drew an invisible thread from Zong Ru’s body, then flapped its wings and hovered in the air above her.

Its sea-blue eyes full of light, where its gaze landed, Zong Ru’s body underwent a strange transformation; it looked like a transparent container, within which a mass of grey-black clouds swirled incessantly.

Having witnessed numerous dreams during the Evolution Ritual, Twelve was keenly aware that this color of mist indicated that Zong Ru was currently experiencing a nightmare.

With their hearts connected, Twelve entered Zong Ru’s nightmare in the next moment.

-----------------

"No… don’t, don’t come any closer!"

Zong Ru screamed, frantically running along the empty and quiet street with two vicious figures closely on her heels.

One of them had already been torn to shreds; from its mangled body, one could make out that it was a wolf-type pet beast.

This mangled body, which hadn’t lost the ability to move in Zong Ru’s dream, had fierce claws filling every torn part of its body. These claws scraped against the ground, endowing it with countless feet that allowed it to move with swift agility.

Their mouths, full of sharp teeth, emitted ferocious and terrifying howls, making one shudder with fear upon hearing them.

The other monster was equally horrifying, if not more so.

It was covered in vague blood, mixed with chunks of viscera and shredded flesh from unknown sources; the stench of its terrible, blood-curdling scent hit one from afar, making it seem like an incredibly frightening devil.

Being chased by such terrifying monsters, Zong Ru’s expression twisted with fear; she kept running but could not escape the pursuit of the two creatures behind her.

A sense of despair spread throughout the entire dreamscape.

When Twelve appeared in the dream, what it saw was the scene unfolding before its eyes.

The figure covered with flesh and chunks of viscera, though monstrously twisted by the power of intent, could still be roughly identified as the Silver Hair King.

Seeing Zong Ru’s extremely fearful countenance, Twelve sighed softly and then fluttered its wings.

In the next moment, the entire dreamscape shattered like a broken mirror, developing many cracks that finally dissipated into countless bubbles.

As the previous images dissipated, the surrounding scenery changed rapidly.@@novelbin@@

On the empty street, indistinct figures began to appear, along with cries of hawkers and the smell of various foods mingling together.

The only distinct figures in the midst of it all were Zong Ru and the towering Silver Hair King behind her.

The large and the small one walked down the street, Zong Ru showing no fear of the Silver Hair King; she even chatted happily with it from time to time.

Twelve quietly observed all this.

It knew that all dreams were sustained by true memories, and what it was seeing now were the real memory fragments corresponding to the nightmare that haunted Zong Ru.

This was the unique power of the Sleeping Bird, which had evolved by absorbing the dreams of ten thousand creatures and developed this instinct during its evolution.

The memory continued, a pet beast resembling a wolf-dog crossed the street and approached Zong Ru and the Silver Hair King.

Faced with this unfamiliar pet beast, Zong Ru showed no undue caution.

But the Silver Hair King behind Zong Ru quickly became wary in its gaze.

The Fighting Attribute beast sensed a dangerous aura emitting from the other.

"Do you want to eat my candied hawthorn?" Zong Ru asked, smiling as she offered her candied hawthorn stick, "Here, for you."

At that moment, a sudden change occurred.

The wolf-type pet beast’s eyes turned blood red in an instant, and it let out a fierce roar as it lunged toward Zong Ru.

The distance between them was extremely short, and just as Zong Ru was about to be torn apart by the creature, an equally fierce roar came from behind her.

The already vigilant Silver Hair King made its move.

The moment the wolf-type pet beast made its move against Zong Ru, the Silver Hair King did not hesitate to categorize it as an enemy.
