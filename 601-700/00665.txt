Chapter 670 - 330: Thunder Dragon Vs Cancan, The True Mastermind Behind The Scenes

"Is it you?"

Staring at the colossal beast before him with a body length of thirty meters, resembling more of an Eastern dragon, draped in flowing electric light across its bright purple scales, and with a mane wildly dancing behind it, Xu Ran’s brow furrowed immediately.

Because he recognized the creature’s identity.

In the adventure map exchanged at the Bright Radiance City Beast Master Association, there was a detailed description of the beast before him.

The Thunder Beast King, the Profound Azure Thunder Dragon.

It dwelled all year round in a distant Thunder Series environment from the Fallen Thunder Valley, and due to its formidable strength, it was listed as one of the most dangerous Transcendent Beings on the adventure map.

Compared with the Beast Kings who had come one after another just now, its strength was on a whole different level, even surpassing the once mighty Lava Beast King.

But...

In Xu Ran’s heart, a trace of confusion arose.

During his prolonged exploration in the past, he had confirmed that there were beings coveting the Extinct Thunder Attraction, not just the obvious ones, but also those lurking in the shadows, hoping to reap the benefits without any effort.

However, Xu Ran’s suspected culprit was not the one before him.

The creature’s abilities did not match those of the one pulling the strings from behind the scenes.

Gazing at Cancan, who roared excitedly, thinking it finally found the mastermind, and who transformed in an instant, swelling its pint-sized body into an immensely huge form and charging toward the Profound Azure Thunder Dragon opposite, Xu Ran gently patted Star next to him.

Star, who was prepared to join the fray, paused in its actions and suddenly adopted the stance of an onlooker.

The reinforcements from the rear failed to grasp Cancan’s attention.

Or rather, it had become so engulfed in the battle spirit that it forgot the fact it had teammates.

With its strength escalating rapidly, Cancan’s figure swelled furiously with the wind.

Ten meters... one hundred meters... five hundred meters... one thousand meters...

A colossal one thousand meters in length, it was like a small mountain peak descending from the sky, emanating an unmatched oppressive force amidst the thunderous light.

And this was merely Cancan’s original body type.

Having reached the King Stage, its original size had already broken past the kilometer mark.

Such a terrifying size would cause a great many jaws to drop merely upon hearing of it.

The Profound Azure Thunder Dragon, too, underwent a change in expression at the very first instance.

It had not just arrived.

As a Great Complement Beast King, the Profound Azure Thunder Dragon was the strongest Thunder Series Spirit in the nearby region, possessing special abilities beyond the reach of ordinary Thunder Attribute extraordinary creatures—namely, the ability to fully elementalize its body and hide within the thunder and lightning.

Long ago, the Profound Azure Thunder Dragon had discovered the hidden special resource here, and judging from the information it had and the various signs on the ground, it concluded that this resource was the incredibly precious Extinct Thunder Attraction for beings of the Thunder Attribute.

Since then, it often transformed into electric light, hiding in the thunder clouds, coming here to investigate. With its unique abilities, not even the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow had any inkling of this.

Now, as the time for the Extinct Thunder Attraction to emerge approached, the ever-watchful Profound Azure Thunder Dragon naturally hadn’t been tardy, lurking in the lightning in the sky all along. The countless bolts brought forth by the emergence of the Extinct Thunder Attraction provided the best cover for it.

Initially, the Profound Azure Thunder Dragon intended to strike the instant the Extinct Thunder Attraction could be moved.

With its power, it didn’t take any of the extraordinary creatures present seriously, nor did it have any reason to hesitate.

However, before the Extinct Thunder Attraction could fully emerge, Ziyun took action.

The thunder that could even be fatal to it made the Profound Azure Thunder Dragon feel wary for the first time.

Even though Ziyun was in an awkward situation when facing the encirclement by the Beast Kings and didn’t release Divine Punishment again, the cautious nature of the Profound Azure Thunder Dragon still stopped it from striking immediately.

Only after completely confirming that Ziyun couldn’t release Divine Punishment again did the Profound Azure Thunder Dragon finally give in to impatience.

It made its move.

It quickly realized, however, that it had seemingly overlooked something very important in its usual caution.

The other Pet Beasts of that human Beast Master.

The Profound Azure Thunder Dragon stared intently at the immense presence before it, rare solemnity swirling in its gaze.

Although the creature before it had a considerable gap in power, far from reaching the complete King Stage, that extraordinary size was proof enough of its uniqueness.

What was more significant was that it was an Earth Attribute King Stage Pet Beast.

The surging Earth attribute Power that filled the nearby void made the Profound Azure Thunder Dragon feel its own Thunderforce beginning to experience a trace of resistance.

The spaces that would have been easily pierced before now had become strenuous to breach due to the density of the Earth attribute Power.

The conductivity of the thunderbolt had decreased, directly affecting its ability to unleash its full strength.

"Buzz~"

At this moment, the Extinct Thunder Attraction that the Profound Azure Thunder Dragon had seized trembled slightly. Sensing the immense power within it, the creature’s originally solemn eyes quickly sharpened.

What did attribute suppression matter, or the strangeness of the opponent?

The resource it had eyed for so long, it was determined to take away today!

Nobody could stop it!

"Roar!!!!"

Alongside a fierce roar, the body of the Profound Azure Thunder Dragon clad in bright purple Dragon Scales became dazzlingly brilliant; its massive form swelled instantly with thunderbolt, and countless Electric Arc blasts surged out to stab into the surrounding void.@@novelbin@@

As if driven by the Profound Azure Thunder Dragon’s Thunderforce, the Extinct Thunder Attraction also began to flicker. Bolts of lightning appeared out of nowhere around it, and then were forcefully absorbed by the Profound Azure Thunder Dragon, becoming a part of itself.
