Chapter 704 - 338 Clues Of The Town Star Stone And The Evolution Of Fireflies_3

"Why didn’t those two Quasi-domineering Level beings use this resource?"

Upon hearing this question, the Black Lion Beast King fell silent for a moment.

"Because this resource cannot be absorbed."

"Hmm?" Xu Ran’s gaze sharpened.

The Dawn Star Radiance can’t be absorbed?

With limited knowledge about this resource, Xu Ran, now hearing what the Black Lion Beast King said, grew even more curious, "Could you elaborate?"

"This resource appeared in the very center of Fallen Star Valley when Fallen Thunder Valley was formed," the Black Lion Beast King recalled with a hint of reminiscence in his eyes, "The Starry Sky Mother studied it the most and believed it to be the core of a fallen star."

"The star struck the earth, its outer layers completely shattered and dissipated, exposing it."

"The core of a fallen star?" Xu Ran couldn’t help but give the pendant hanging around Star’s neck a few more glances.

It didn’t look it, but this Dawn Star Radiance actually had an impressive origin.

"Yes." The Black Lion Beast King slowly began, "It’s extremely sturdy, so much so that even when two Quasi-domineering Level beings joined forces, they couldn’t destroy it."

"It contains a powerful force within, but this force cannot be absorbed by either of the Overlords."

"The Starry Sky Mother once tried to use it as Evolution Material to take the critical step toward becoming an Emperor Species, but ultimately failed, and the resource remained unscathed."

"Since then, this resource has been left within these caverns."

"That difficult?" Xu Ran couldn’t help but click his tongue upon hearing the Black Lion Beast King’s words, "But it seems quite absorbable to me?"

"How could that be?" The Black Lion Beast King instinctively glanced in Star’s direction, then suddenly froze in place.

Because the Dawn Star Radiance hanging around Star’s neck was, at that moment, twinkling as it gradually released its energy, transmitting it into Star’s body.

The Black Lion Beast King couldn’t help but widen his eyes, his shock even surpassing that of Ziyun killing the Starry Sky Mother.

The Dawn Star Radiance had been around for hundreds of years with no creature ever able to absorb its power; it was unimaginable that it would make an exception for the being before them.

After a long silence, the Black Lion Beast King’s eyes filled with a hint of admiration.

"Perhaps this resource has found its true master."

-----------------

Having obtained the Dawn Star Radiance, Xu Ran, along with the five smaller Transcendent Beings who were not shaking in terror as usual, left Fallen Star Valley immediately.

On the way back to the city, Star’s steps were unusually light.

With this resource acquired, only one last piece of Evolution Material was missing.

The Town Star Stone.

As for how to obtain the Town Star Stone, that was a matter for further consideration.

With the eye-catching Dawn Star Radiance hanging on Star, it couldn’t maintain its concealment perfectly, shining like a beacon in the night and drawing covetous gazes.

However, when Ziyun once again displayed the Imperial Crown, those glances instantly vanished.

The Emperor Species was not to be trifled with.

Before long, Xu Ran and his five pets returned to their shop in Xuanxing City.

It was only when they lay on the comfortable big bed that they felt a semblance of peace.

"Ding-dong—"@@novelbin@@

A smartphone notification sounded at that moment.

Xu Ran picked up his phone and saw an unread message.

The sender of the message was Qi Yuan.

After a glance at the message, Xu Ran’s face lit up with surprise, "Star, there’s news about the Town Star Stone!"

"Xi Lu?!" (Really?!)

Star, still basking in the joy of acquiring the Dawn Star Radiance, abruptly lifted its head, eyes bursting with an astonishing light.

"Do you remember, when we visited Elder Qi Yuan at noon, what he said?" Xu Ran shook his phone with a smile.

"Xuanxing City’s protective Star Array can’t be destroyed, so the Town Star Stone there cannot be obtained, but Elder Qi Yuan helped us find the location of another Town Star Stone," Xu Ran chuckled, "Elder Qi Yuan sent the address over."

"Xi Lu?" (Where is it?)

Star was full of anticipation.

It couldn’t wait to set off, heading straight for the place where the Town Star Stone was produced.

"It’s a place called the Silent Abyss," Xu Ran checked carefully, "Elder Qi Yuan is so considerate; he even attached a map in the attachment."

"Let me see... huh?"

After seeing the location marked on the map, Xu Ran’s eyes involuntarily widened, "What a coincidence?"

"Huh?" (What’s up?)

Cancan couldn’t help but ask.

Upon hearing the name "Silent Abyss," its adventurous spirit instantly flared up.

It sounded like a fascinating place!

"This place is very close to Poison Flame Valley," Xu Ran said with a grin, "Poison Flame Valley is where I’ve chosen for Firefly to evolve."

"Lu ho?" (Is that so?)

Firefly, who originally thought this had little to do with itself, suddenly lit up.

What a coincidence!

"Indeed, quite the coincidence," Xu Ran nodded with a smile, "In this way, with one trip, we can seek clues about the Town Star Stone and help Firefly evolve."

"Xi Lu~" (That’s great!)

Star nodded joyously.

"Jiu?" (So when do we leave?)

Twelve tilted its head to the side, its eyes also filled with interest.

Whether it was Firefly’s evolution or clues about the Town Star Stone, it was very keen to know.

"About that..." Xu Ran’s face took on a contemplative expression. After a moment, he made up his mind, "Well, how about this: once the pet fostering exhibition is over, we’ll set off."
