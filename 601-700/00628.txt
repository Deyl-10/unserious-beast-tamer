Equally dumbfounded was the Twelve nestled in Xu Ran’s arms.

That’s not right?

This is not right!

Since when did Star also gain a Four Star Skill?

That skill Ziyun just used didn’t seem like its usual Immortal Body, did it?

How long has it been since I saw them, and they have new Four Star Skills?

In an instant, an additional hint of resentment towards its "dad" formed in Twelve’s heart.

If it hadn’t been captured by its "dad," it might also have a Four Star Skill by now!

It then immediately turned its gaze towards Cancan, who was stepping out.

This guy wouldn’t also have a new Four Star Skill, would he?

The next moment, Twelve found some comfort from Cancan’s performance.

Thankfully, the Four Star Skill Cancan mastered was still the same as before.

After the three little ones finished displaying their skills, Xu Ran once again met eyes with the Nightmare Beast King. "Senior, can I now form a contract with Twelve?"

The Nightmare Beast King fell silent for a moment.

Witnessing three King Species Pet Beasts displaying Four Star Skills in person, its preconceived notions were strongly challenged at this moment.

Undoubtedly, if Xu Ran could elevate Three Star Skills to Four Stars, then upgrading Two Star Skills to Three Stars would be even simpler for him.

"You may." In the end, the Nightmare Beast King nodded its head.

"Yay!" Cancan couldn’t help but let out a cheer.

Under its influence, Ziyun and Star also cheered together.

Watching the three little ones getting excited, Xu Ran smiled and then pulled forth the fourth contract slot that had been vacant for a long time, quickly forming a contract with Twelve in his arms.

[Host: Xu Ran

Contract Power: Fourth Stage

Contract Pet Beast:

Ziyun [View Details]

Star [View Details]

Cancan [View Details]

Twelve [View Details]

...]

Looking at the updated personal panel in front of him, Xu Ran casually clicked on Twelve’s panel.

[Contract Pet Beast: Twelve

Race name: Velvet Sparrow

Attribute: Super ability

Growth Stage: Elite Stage (20000/20000)

Race Tier: Leader Species

Skills:

[★★ Order of No Conquest (Full Moon Level)](0/10000)

[★★ Illusory Scenery (Full Moon Level)](0/10000)[+]

[★★ Shadow of Deterrence (Waning Moon Level)](968/2000)[+]

[★★ Soul Shatter Roar (Waning Moon Level)](122/2000)[+]

[★ Mind Induction (Waning Moon Level)](312/2000)[+]]

It was clear that Twelve had been busy during their time apart.

Not only had it acquired a second Full Moon Level skill, but it had also elevated its Soul Shatter Roar, previously at Starlight Level, to Waning Moon Level.

With this, the proficiency requirements for evolution were completely met.

All that was lacking now was an upgrade in its Talent Skills.

"Chirp~" (I’ve been waiting for this day!)

Twelve also let out a cheer, but soon noticed the unusual look in its old father’s eyes and quickly settled down again.@@novelbin@@

Sighing in resignation in its heart, the Nightmare Beast King turned to Xu Ran and suddenly fluttered its wing.

One by one, resources appeared before Xu Ran.

Dreamer’s Shadow, Dream Weaving Silkworm Silk, Fantasy Crystals, Life Dewdrop, Transcendence Flower.

At a glance, Xu Ran recognized these as the resources needed for Twelve’s evolution.

The next moment, the Nightmare Beast King fiercely slashed its wing against another, leaving a fierce wound, then peeled off a drop of blood glowing with a rich blue-purple light, making it float in front of Xu Ran.

Super ability Attribute King Stage Blood Essence.

With this, all the materials for Twelve’s evolution were gathered.

A look of astonishment appeared on Xu Ran’s face.

He had planned to quickly gather the materials needed by Twelve after forming the contract, but he did not expect the Nightmare Beast King to take this step in advance.

The surprises the Nightmare Beast King brought to Xu Ran did not stop there.

"I have already conquered Beast Field 97 and can summon tens of thousands of wild Transcendent Beings at any time to perform mass hypnosis, meeting the requirements for Twelve’s Evolution Ritual."

The Nightmare Beast King looked at Xu Ran, pausing slightly.

"Now, can we upgrade Twelve’s Talent Skills?"
