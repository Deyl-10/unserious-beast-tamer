Chapter 679 - 332: The Powerful Astonishing Cloud Chaser, The Next Target_2

Recalling the perilous evolution just now, Ziyun’s heart was still in turmoil.

"Chia~" (I want to endure such hardships too~)

Cancan, back to its pocket-sized body type, couldn’t help but mutter softly.

After Ziyun had completed its evolution, it had looked at Ziyun several times.

As Ziyun’s strength had greatly increased following the breakthrough, its brief reign as the strongest in the team had to be relinquished.

Damn it!

Star and the twelve, though they didn’t speak, also looked at Ziyun with eyes full of envy.

As for Firefly, who hadn’t come to Fallen Thunder Valley but had remotely watched the entire process, was so envious that it was rolling around on the bed.

Emperor Species!

From Ziyun, they could clearly feel that overwhelming strength which utterly surpassed their own, a complete crushing of life levels.

This was the allure of evolution.

In an instant, those who had already acquired the evolution path of the Emperor Species rubbed their hands together in eager anticipation, their will to evolve stronger than ever before.

Those who had not obtained the evolution path of the Emperor Species were even more looking forward to the next resource allocation, hoping for a new evolution path.

They too wanted to become stronger!

"With Ziyun’s evolution coming to an end, it’s also a conclusion to this chapter." Sensing the mood of the other four, Xu Ran smiled and looked around.

The once Fallen Thunder Valley, after this battle, had many of its surrounding peaks leveled, the terrain had greatly changed, and with the Extinct Thunder Attraction absorbed by Ziyun, the endless thunderclouds dissipated.

In a sense, the world no longer had a Fallen Thunder Valley.

"Let’s go back," Xu Ran said softly, then turned to Ziyun, "You must also take the Divine Punishment and Rebound as soon as possible."

No sooner had he spoken than Ziyun, originally in a great mood from evolving into an Emperor Species, suddenly looked crestfallen.@@novelbin@@

Divine Punishment and Rebound!

It had almost forgotten about that.

Thinking of the past pain it had experienced, Ziyun’s expression was filled with conflicted emotions and helplessness.

It wanted to escape, but there was no escape.

Unless it never used Divine Punishment again, it had to face the rebound sooner or later.

But, Divine Punishment was really useful!

So far, Ziyun had not seen any ability more powerful than it; with one explosion of power, it could easily defeat stronger enemies.

"Meow~" (Let’s go back~)

Ziyun let out a long sigh, showing an expression of resigned determination.

Half an hour later, within the Starfire Foster Care Shop in Bright Radiance City, Ziyun’s scream, full of sheer agony, could be heard.

-----------------

"Alright, let’s pack our bags."

Touching Ziyun in his arms, who was looking desolate from enduring the Divine Punishment and Rebound, Xu Ran spoke with a smile, "It’s time to leave Bright Radiance City."

Choosing to open a branch in Bright Radiance City was because it was close to the Extinct Thunder Attraction, making it easy to monitor the situation.

Now that the Extinct Thunder Attraction has been secured, and the branch’s fame requirement has been met, staying here no longer had any purpose.

It was time to head to a new city, to open the fourth branch store in a Second Level Town.

"Xi Lu~" (Where will we go next?)

Star neighed inquisitively, curious about their next destination.

"The next city we’re going to has some connection to you," Xu Ran smiled and looked at Star.

"Xi Lu?" (Me?)

Surprise flashed in Star’s eyes, clearly unexpected that the next destination would be related to itself.

"That’s right." Xu Ran nodded, "With Ziyun having successfully completed its evolution, according to the sequence of obtaining the Emperor Species evolution path and the fulfillment of evolution conditions, you are next in line to evolve."

"You haven’t forgotten your Evolution Ritual, have you?"

"Xi Lu~" (Of course not!)

Without hesitation, Star shook its head.

Concerning its own evolution, it memorized every word about the Evolution Conditions, Evolution Materials, and Evolution Ritual—it couldn’t possibly forget.

To evolve into Star Cloud Guardian, the Evolution Ritual consisted of two steps.

First, assist a Transcendent Being below the Monarch Stage in defeating a Dark King Level Transcendent Being, obtaining its core resources as auxiliary materials for the evolution.

Second, complete the evolution during Star Cloud Night when the stars are shining.

According to the initial plan, the first step was for it to assist Ziyun in defeating a Dark King Level opponent.

But life is full of unexpected events, and they had not encountered a suitable Dark King Level opponent during this time, and among the combatants for Extinct Thunder Attraction, none were of the Dark Attribute.

Now that Ziyun and Cancan had both reached the Monarch Stage, Star would have to switch the subject of its assistance to either Twelve or Firefly.

But Star was not worried.

It believed in the rapid improvement of its companions’ strength.

And this step of the Evolution Ritual didn’t pick a place.

So, Xu Ran mentioning the next destination being related to itself could only be connected to the other part of the Evolution Ritual.

During Star Cloud Night, amidst the reflections of the stars, complete the evolution.

"Xi Lu?" (Are we going to a city with stars?)

"Exactly," Xu Ran nodded slightly, "I happen to know of such a city that can satisfy the requirement of ’stars shining together’."

"There, should be very suitable for you to complete your evolution."
