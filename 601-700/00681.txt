Chapter 686 - 334: Xuanxing City Starfire Foster Care Shop, Grand Opening!

On the quiet streets early in the morning, two figures hurried along.

Suddenly, one of them came to a stop.

Noticing something amiss, the other turned his head and asked, "Mu, coming?"

"When did a foster shop pop up here?" Tang Mu’s gaze settled on a store by the street, his curiosity piqued.

"Starfire Foster?" His companion, Zhou Yong, followed his line of sight with interest, then shook his head, "Haven’t heard of it. Must be a new opening, right?"

"Let’s hurry to the Pingtian Foster Shop. I’ve heard it offers the best foster care service in the entire Xuanxing City; I’m even a bit jealous of your pet beast," Zhou Yong chuckled.

"Hold on," Tang Mu paused for a moment, "I’d like to check out this place first before deciding."

"Oh my ancestors, to find a satisfactory foster shop for your pet beast, we’ve nearly checked out every single shop in Xuanxing City," Zhou Yong rolled his eyes, struggling to hide his impatience, "We finally settled on Pingtian Foster Shop, and now you want to scout this place?"

"It’s my pet beast’s first time in foster care; I have to find the most suitable environment for it," Tang Mu spoke earnestly, "Honestly, if its body type hadn’t grown too much with evolution, I would never consider such a choice."

"Now that we’ve discovered a foster shop we haven’t seen before, why not take a look? What if, by chance, this shop has an even better environment than Pingtian Foster Shop?"

"You stubborn guy," Zhou Yong shook his head in resignation.

He was no stranger to his good friend’s quirky temperament.

Now that Tang Mu had made up his mind, it was like trying to pull eight oxen back.

"Fine, but we go straight to Pingtian Foster Shop after checking out this one," Zhou Yong said with a roll of his eyes, "All this time spent on finding a foster store for a pet beast, and you always drag me along. Give me a break!"

As for the possibility of this shop having a better foster environment than Pingtian Foster Shop, Zhou Yong hadn’t even considered it.

What a joke, Pingtian Foster Shop is long-established and well-known in Xuanxing City, whereas he had never heard of the one in front of him until today.

"Alright." Tang Mu nodded, a hint of embarrassment on his face.

He realized how taxing the recent days must have been for Zhou Yong, running around Xuanxing City to find a suitable foster shop for his pet beast.

But he didn’t have many friends, and Zhou Yong was the only one with experience in pet fostering, so he had no choice but to ask for his help and advice.

"I’ll treat you to lunch at noon."

"It’s a deal, I’ll have something expensive," Zhou Yong’s spirits instantly lifted.

Having reached an agreement, the two hastened towards the foster shop beside the street.

Inside the Starfire Foster Care Shop, having just finished breakfast with the five little ones, Xu Ran stretched leisurely and looked out nonchalantly at the somewhat deserted streets.

After having dinner with Liu Fengyun the previous night and then separating, the new storefront had just been completed. After checking the entire premises, they settled in for the night.

A night passed, and Xu Ran woke up early to start the first day of business at the Starfire Foster in Xuanxing City.

Unlike the Starfire Foster in Bright Radiance City, this time, Xu Ran had the luxury of not feeling too much pressure to raise the shop’s fame. He could just let things take their natural course.

He definitely wouldn’t leave here before Star’s evolution.

And Star’s evolution was clearly not something that could be accomplished quickly.

In terms of evolution conditions, Star still needed to raise four skills to four stars, and three more skills to reach Violent Sun Level proficiency.

Regarding evolution materials, Star still lacked the Town Star Stone and Dawn Star Radiance, two key substances.

So, if Star could evolve in one or two months, that would be quite good.

Therefore, not having any customers come in for an hour of opening the shop, he still maintained his composure.

After sipping some Fallen Star Tea he had bought on his way out of the restaurant the day before, Xu Ran felt invigorated and his mind became clearer.

Besides Star’s evolution, there was another matter that needed to be scheduled.

That was the evolution of Starfire into a King Species.

Now, with more and more resources at his disposal, evolving a Leader Species into a King Species had become a walk in the park for Xu Ran.

Just one allocation of resources had been enough for Starfire to meet all evolution conditions and gather the necessary materials.

The only thing holding back its evolution was the slightly special Evolution Ritual.

The place where Heart Burning Poisonous Flame Marrow grew was located in three parts of Beast Field 47 according to the intelligence Xu Ran had exchanged.

Among these three places, one was within the dominion of a Beast King - a no-go; the other two each had their pros and cons.

One was on the edge of Beast Field 47, where neighboring zones contained Transcendent Beings of weaker strength, making it safer, but it was also farther from Xu Ran.

The nearest of the four branches that Xu Ran ran in Beast Field 47 was still a three-day journey away from it.

The other was central in Beast Field 47, very close to Xieyun City, only one or two hours away.

However, this region was populated with stronger Transcendent Beings, including over a dozen Beast Kings.

Originally, Xu Ran preferred the former for its safety despite the distance.

Now, following Ziyun’s evolution, Xu Ran had decided to choose the latter as the site for Starfire’s evolution.

Beast Kings?

Ha!

Put together they wouldn’t even be a match for a single Ziyun!

But there’s no rush on this matter. It could wait a few more days, giving Starfire some time to prepare as well.
