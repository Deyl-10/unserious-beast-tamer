Chapter 612 - 315: The First Resident Of The Foster Area

[Under Revision, check again tomorrow night]

"The feathers at the very end of the Raw Thunder Owl’s wings are composed of thunder elements. Feathers of this energy form can repair themselves after wear and tear, and they allow the owls to fly faster."

"But the downside is also obvious. Feathers in an energy state are unable to clearly sense wind direction, and this lack of subtle perception results in the Raw Thunder Owls having speed without the flexibility in flight."

"The reason why the Raw Thunder Owls at the base keep changing directions during flight is to train their flexibility in flight, to make up for their own shortcomings."

"I understand." Song Xuan was quickly jotting down Xu Ran’s explanations and, after a moment, smiled in relief. "The last species, I’ve seen them all."

"Mhm." Xu Ran nodded.

Finally having reviewed all the Pet Beasts of the Green Bud Pet Beast Breeding Base, Xu Ran had an initial estimate of the conditions of the hundred or so Pet Beasts awaiting Washing and Protection.

Thanks to Song Xuan’s unique free-range breeding methods, these Pet Beasts had figured out quite a few small life skills to help maintain their condition.

Although they had not received Washing and Protection before, their conditions were still pretty good, with only a very few having Washing and Protection requirements exceeding Four Stars.

This would accordingly reduce the workload for Washing and Protection.

"Those few Pet Beasts that I pointed out earlier, bring them to my Foster Shop in the next two days for Washing and Protection." Xu Ran instructed, "I’ll set aside special time later to provide Washing and Protection for the rest."

"No problem." Song Xuan nodded without hesitation, lifting up the notebook in his hands, showing a grateful expression, "And thank you for sharing this knowledge with me today. I believe it will greatly improve everyone’s impression of the beasts at the base."

"I just hope that these fine Pet Beasts can find suitable Beast Masters as soon as possible," Xu Ran said, pausing slightly, then turned his head toward the little one that followed closely behind him, covered in fiery-colored fur, "Besides, you’ve already given a thanks gift."

After leaving the Fire-tailed Bear’s living area, Number Six, who had decided to follow Xu Ran, joined the visiting group and followed closely behind Xu Ran, just like the other three young ones.

At first, it felt somewhat aloof from Cancan and Ziyun, but this feeling of strangeness quickly faded as the three little ones chattered back and forth with it.

It was now tentatively becoming part of the group.

"Number Six is also lucky to be able to follow you," Song Xuan said with a smile, suddenly reminding her, "But Mr. Xu, ’Number Six’ is just its code name. When you take it back, you can give it a better name."

"Don’t worry," Xu Ran nodded seriously, "I’m very good at naming."

Upon hearing this, Ziyun, who was whispering with the other three young ones, suddenly wore an odd expression on its face.

It wondered how on earth the individual who had almost named it "Electra" could think so highly of his naming skills...

"It’s getting late, and I have to open for business this afternoon, so I must say goodbye now." Feeling the faint disdain from Ziyun behind him, Xu Ran chuckled and swiftly bid farewell to Song Xuan.

"Star!"

"Xi Lu Lu~" (Here!)

Star neighed, stretching a few inches taller to facilitate better communication with Number Six, having shrunk earlier for the same purpose.

It stepped forward with raised forehoofs, approaching Xu Ran’s side, ready to be mounted.

"Luhou?" (What’s this?)

Watching Star’s movements, Number Six blinked its eyes in surprise.

Star’s ability to enlarge wasn’t surprising to it; it should have noted Star shrinking in front of it earlier.

However, recently integrated into the group of one human and three beasts, it was still somewhat clueless about what was to come.

"Cha~" (We’re going home!)

Cancan, the second one to befriend Number Six and naturally sociable, extended a paw to pat Number Six on the shoulder, excitedly speaking.

Going home?

Number Six paused, followed swiftly by a surge of eager anticipation in its eyes.
