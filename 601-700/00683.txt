Chapter 688 - 334: Xuanxing City Starfire Foster Shop, Grand Opening!_3

Unfortunately, his Pet Beast no longer needed to be fostered.

Even a golden nest or a silver nest is not as good as one’s own dog nest.

Otherwise, he would definitely choose this Foster Shop.

Completely forgetting that just ten minutes ago he still thought this shop was a Black Shop, Zhou Yong turned to look at Tang Mu, "What’s there to hesitate about? Let’s go with this place."

Who says Pingtian Foster Shop is the number one in Xuanxing City?

In his opinion, it won’t be long before this shop surpasses Pingtian Foster Shop.

Tang Mu was also very tempted in his heart.

However, he was well aware that for fostering, the environment was only one aspect.

There was still another part that needed to be evaluated.

"I would like to know, how do you usually prepare food for the fostered Pet Beasts?" Tang Mu asked earnestly.

"We have a specialized food preparation room, please come this way." Xu Ran smiled and quickly took them to a house where food was prepared.

After taking a tour inside, Xu Ran magically produced a long list, "If you choose our store for fostering, this will be the Wind Roar Beast’s daily menu."

"This..." Tang Mu only glanced at it and couldn’t take his eyes off it anymore.

The food was much more sumptuous than what he prepared for the Wind Roar Beast, and it seemed very well-balanced nutritionally, leaving him unable to find fault.

"We’ll settle on your place." After handing back the menu to Xu Ran, Tang Mu made his decision.

"Thank you for choosing our shop." A smile appeared on Xu Ran’s face.

Excellent, the new store’s first business deal was closed!

Reluctantly leaving the Wind Roar Beast in the foster area, Tang Mu and Zhou Yong followed Xu Ran back into the storefront.

Without any hesitation, Tang Mu paid for a month of fostering fees and then turned to Xu Ran, "Boss Xu, I’m entrusting my Wind Roar Beast to you."

"Rest assured, our shop will take great care of each fostered Pet Beast, making them feel at home," Xu Ran said solemnly.

"Speaking of which, your shop is really peculiar." Zhou Yong chuckled, "I just realized that not only is fostering expensive here, but the cleaning and accompanying training services are also more expensive than elsewhere."

"But like fostering, our prices depend on the service," Xu Ran replied with a smile.

"Oh? So you’re saying your Washing and Protection is better than other places?" Zhou Yong said, half-believing, "Really?"

"Fostering environments can be improved with those expensive techniques, but how much can washing and protection improve?" Zhou Yong said skeptically, "The best washing and protection in Xuanxing City at Wind Cloud Foster Shop is already the most impressive I’ve seen."

"Well..." Xu Ran smiled, "It’s just talk with no proof, sir. You might as well try it, and after trying, you’ll naturally see the difference."

"After I try it, I’ll have to pay," Zhou Yong rolled his eyes, then changed his tone, "But I really do want to try it."

His Pet Beast just happened to need cleaning and grooming.

Based on what he had just witnessed, Zhou Yong was indeed curious about what made this pricey Washing and Protection so special.

"But let me be blunt," Zhou Yong huffed, "I’m a regular at Wind Cloud Foster Shop. I’m not completely inexperienced with pet cleaning and grooming, so it won’t be easy to pull the wool over my eyes."

"Of course we won’t fool you," Xu Ran smiled, "Please."

"Alright!" Zhou Yong turned to Tang Mu, "Old Tang, are you going back first?"

"You said you were treating me to lunch, why go back now?" Tang Mu shook his head, "You accompanied me for several days of inspections, accompanying you for a grooming session is nothing."

"Besides, I’m curious about the level of grooming at this shop too."

"Fair enough." Zhou Yong laughed heartily as the Hexagram Star Array behind him bloomed with light.

Before long, a monkey-type Pet Beast enveloped in blazing flames stepped out of the whirlwind.

Fire Attribute King Species, Refining Flame Monkey.

"Boss Xu, this one," Zhou Yong said with arms crossed and a teasing smile.

Choosing this particular one from his Pet Beasts, Zhou Yong obviously didn’t do so randomly.

Even though it was a King Species, the Refining Flame Monkey wasn’t large in size; even at the General stage, it remained a Medium Size Pet Beast, and the cost of its grooming was lower.

As a Fire Attribute Pet Beast, the Refining Flame Monkey was also the most difficult to groom among all of Zhou Yong’s Pet Beasts.

He wanted to spend less money, and at the same time, fully test the grooming skills of the young shop owner before him. Zhou Yong couldn’t help but pat himself on the back for his cleverness.

"No problem," Xu Ran glanced at the Refining Flame Monkey, not at all bothered by the fact that it was a Fire Attribute.

No matter what Attribute, once they enter the Washing and Protection room, they’ll have to cry out!

System Identification, here we go!

[Race Name: Refining Flame Monkey

Attribute: Fire

Growth Stage: General Level

Body Type: Medium

Washing and Protection Requirement: ★★★☆☆

Evaluation: The scorching flames cover its body, longing for grooming; this is one burning monkey that craves the deft touch of its Host to bring it joy!]

Burning monkey…@@novelbin@@

Xu Ran was momentarily at a loss for words.

System, oh system, this monkey might be flaming hot, but you’re saucier.

"Please follow me," Xu Ran regained his composure and turned towards the direction of the grooming room.

"Go on, go on," Zhou Yong waved towards the Refining Flame Monkey and chuckled with a grin.

He didn’t have the habit of accompanying his Pet Beast during the grooming process.

That’s because Zhou Yong believed that seeing the state of the Pet Beast after the grooming, without watching the process, could give a clearer sense of the before and after comparison.

Zhou Yong engaged his sensory sharing with the Refining Flame Monkey.

That way, he could better experience what the Refining Flame Monkey felt during the grooming.
