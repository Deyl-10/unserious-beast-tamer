Chapter 674 - 331 Difficult Victory, Ziyun Evolves!

"What a tough guy."

Xu Ran muttered under his breath, his expression turning even graver as Cancan temporarily fell.

Clearly, the creature before him had been here for quite some time, familiar with every ability Cancan had already used.

The Phantom Thunder Gryphon in the sky swept its gaze over Cancan, finally settling on Xu Ran.

It had thought that the Beast Master before it had already revealed his full strength, but unexpectedly, he still had cards up his sleeve.

Fortunately, its companion’s illusion didn’t affect it, and it managed to dodge the powerful strike at the critical moment.

"Humans, hand over the Extinct Thunder Attraction."

The deep voice of the Phantom Thunder Gryphon echoed throughout Fallen Thunder Valley.

It stared at the Extinct Thunder Attraction in Xu Ran’s hands, a hint of chilling intent flashing through its eyes. Continue your journey on empire

"You must be dreaming," Xu Ran said, gripping the long sword transformed from Ziyun without hesitation and slashing out once more.

The sword’s gleam, carrying the terrifying power of thunder and darkness, ripped through the sky with a piercing boom and headed straight for the Phantom Thunder Gryphon.

"If you’re not awake, let me wake you up!"

"Presumptuous!"

The anger in the eyes of the Phantom Thunder Gryphon intensified. It flapped its wings rapidly, its feathers glowing with lightning instantly turning into energy, which then transformed into countless thunderbolt needles shooting towards the sword’s gleam.@@novelbin@@

For a moment, needles like a screen swept across the sky.

Three Star Skill, Violent Sun Level: Phantom Thunder Needles!

"Boom!!"

With a thunderous roar sounding like thunder, the two immensely powerful attacks collided instantly. Their colliding energies shattered, constantly rippling, and countless lightning bolts uncontrollably swirled within the energy storm.

As the lightning faded, the numerous thunderbolt needles vanished into the void, and the strike that Xu Ran had swung also disappeared into thin air.

The Phantom Thunder Gryphon proved with its actions that even without dodging, Xu Ran’s sword strikes were useless against it.

"Since you refuse to see reason, then stay here forever!" The Gryphon roared, folding its wings and swiftly descending towards Xu Ran.

A torrent of invisible Super ability Attribute power, mixed with violent Thunderforce, rapidly gathered around it, dragging a long trail in the void and forming a frightening sword light.

The Phantom Thunder Gryphon, with its body as the sword tip, gained speed, eventually becoming almost just an afterimage, with its sharp momentum and boundless fighting spirit, it slashed down in an instant.

Three Star Skill, Violent Sun Level: Sword of Demon Slaying!

Watching the swiftly enlarging sword light in his vision, Xu Ran’s expression quickly turned serious. Initially gripping the sword with one hand, he now pressed his other hand firmly on the hilt, pointing the sword tip towards the sound of the Phantom Thunder Gryphon’s charge.

"Xi Lu Lu~"

Starlight let out a screech, its surging starlight and dark veil rapidly circulating, as if forming a splendid Star Cloud. Facing the Gryphon’s powerful attack, it had already pushed the Prayer of Starry Night and Star Oath to the limit.

With the momentum reaching its peak, Xu Ran too completed his buildup.

In the instant the Phantom Thunder Gryphon pounced, he savagely slashed with his sword.

The sharpness of the sword’s strike surged around him, and behind Xu Ran, a shadowy long sword formed, slashing out in unison with his own sword.

The dazzling gleam of the sword detached from the blade, heading straight for the Phantom Thunder Gryphon.

In the next instant, sword gleam and sword light touched.

"Boom!!!"

Another violent boom ensued, and dust rose throughout Fallen Thunder Valley.

Once the dust had settled, the Phantom Thunder Gryphon’s figure reappeared; its wings trembled violently as if it had not completely shed the force of the recent collision. A bloodstain slowly emerged on its chest, continuously oozing blood.

On the other side, Xu Ran didn’t fare much better.

The Star Cloud that enshrouded him and Starlight had completely dimmed and shattered, with streaks of blood appearing on Xu Ran and Starlight, making them look quite disheveled.

The position where Starlight fought was no longer where it had struck previously.

The nearly thousand-meter-long scar on the ground was the result of the Phantom Thunder Gryphon’s ferocious attack.

As the starlight gathered bit by bit, the wounds on Xu Ran and Starlight healed at a visibly rapid pace. He gasped heavily, then looked towards the Gryphon again, "You’re not that great either, huh?"

"Such strong recovery."

The Phantom Thunder Gryphon watched the wounds on Xu Ran and Starlight heal completely within breaths, its eyes showing a sign of seriousness for the first time.

The most troublesome opponents in battle were those like these.

In a battle of attrition, even ants can wear down an elephant.

However, having managed to increase its strength so much in obscurity, the Phantom Thunder Gryphon was naturally not a common foe.

With its rich combat experience, it knew how to deal with such opponents.

Give up or make it quick.

Since the enemy held the Extinct Thunder Attraction, it couldn’t give up.

So...

The Phantom Thunder Gryphon forcefully controlled the muscles around its chest, clamping the torn wound to stop the bleeding, then without hesitation flapped its wings again, rushing towards Xu Ran.

With thunderous roars and rising dust, Xu Ran and the Phantom Thunder Gryphon crossed paths time after time.

Empowered by both the Extinct Thunder Attraction and Star Oath, Xu Ran was able to exchange blows with the Phantom Thunder Gryphon. In the blink of an eye, they had clashed dozens of times.

The injuries on Xu Ran and Starlight grew more numerous, but as they fought, they healed, hardly burdening them.
