Chapter 642 - 322: The Trail Of The Sparrow Behind The Scenes_3

"Meow?" (Are there others?)

Ziyun was taken aback and couldn’t help but ask, his expression becoming much more solemn.

According to the information they had gathered earlier, the only Thunder Attribute Beast Kings guarding the Extinct Thunder Attraction were the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow and the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King, the latter of which they had ambushed and successfully killed.

Logically, only the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow should be a potential threat to them.

After hearing Ziyun’s doubts, Twelve shook its head slightly.

"Chirp~" (In the wild, Transcendent Beings may find a resource useful to them but not immediately obtainable. Staying there is just one way to guard it.)

"Chirp~" (Besides, there are those who, after ensuring the safety of the resource, will leave their mark and surveillance methods, and then wait for the prey to arrive.)

(In general, the latter is more dangerous than the former.)

(Because the former is also their hunting target.)

"Xi Lu~" (Is that so?)

Star neighed, and upon hearing Twelve’s words, its expression became solemn too.

If what Twelve said was true, then were Thunder Patterned Gold Willow and the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King just the visible forces, with potentially one or even several more powerful Transcendent Beings lurking in the darkness, eyeing the Extinct Thunder Attraction?@@novelbin@@

"Meow~" (Is there a way to discover them?)

Ziyun grew anxious.

The unknown is the most terrifying thing.

Not knowing how many Beast Kings they would have to fight over the Extinct Thunder Attraction in the future was causing anxious restlessness.

Fortunately, Twelve quickly provided a positive response.

"Chirp~" (There is a way.)

As the daughter of the Nightmare Beast King, who had spent a long time with the Beast King, Twelve was extremely sensitive to the aura at the Beast King Level.

As long as it could visit the Fallen Thunder Valley once, it was confident it could confirm whether strong Beast Kings coveting the Extinct Thunder Attraction had left their marks.

"Cha!" (No time to waste, let’s go tonight!)

Cancan shouted excitedly, eyes filled with the thrill of adventure.

It, Cancan the Explorer, was ready to make a comeback!

"Meow~" (Let’s inform Xu Ran about this first.)

Ziyun took a deep breath and used Contractual Sensing to reach out to Xu Ran, who was busy.

In the cleaning room, Xu Ran’s hands, which were caring for a Pet Beast, paused slightly.

What does this mean?

According to Twelve’s speculation about wild Transcendent Beings, could there be more Beast Kings eyeing the Extinct Thunder Attraction besides the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow?

He suddenly felt a headache coming on.

This could be troublesome.

Luckily, Twelve also said that it wasn’t certain.

Whether it was true or not, they needed to investigate in person.

"Boss Xu? Is there a problem with my Pet Beast?" The customer, who had been intently watching Xu Ran’s movements, couldn’t help but ask when he stopped.

Even the Pet Beast, which had been immensely enjoying its Washing and Protection, cast a grievous look at him.

Continue, won’t you!

"Ah, sorry." Xu Ran quickly apologized and pulled his attention back to the task at hand, while replying to the four little ones through Contractual Sensing.

"Tonight we act." This was its first mission with its buddies since forming a contract with Xu Ran.

It must exert a part of its own power!

And in this regard, Twelve had an advantage that the other three didn’t.

It came from the Beast Field, from a group of wild Extraordinary Creatures.

It understood the group of wild Extraordinary Creatures better than Xu Ran and the other three.

After a moment of thought, Twelve suddenly spoke out.

"Chirp~" (If I’m not mistaken, there should be more than just the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow that discovered the Extinct Thunder Attraction.)

"Meow?" (Are there others?)
