Chapter 604 - 313 Green Bud Pet Beast Breeding Base

[Under revision, available tomorrow morning]@@novelbin@@

Having decided how to arrange Song Xuan’s tasks, Xu Ran glanced at the business card in hand and remembered something else.

Just now, Song Xuan had invited him to first visit her Pet Beast Breeding Base.

And he was indeed somewhat interested.

On one hand, an on-site visit would allow him to see the specific conditions of the Pet Beasts that required Washing and Protection.

How many small size, medium size, how many large size, and how many Pet Beasts with Washing and Protection requirements above four stars—these would all be clear at a glance.

On the other hand...

Xu Ran was genuinely curious about the Pet Beast Breeding Base.

Thinking about it, he had already been at the Fourth Stage for some time.

With the meditation speed provided by stacking two Meditation Acceleration Cards, Xu Ran could feel the beckoning of the Fifth Stage from afar.

If nothing unexpected happened, his breakthrough should occur in no more than two months.

Therefore, considering the choice for his fifth contract beast needed to be scheduled in advance.

Although he had not reclaimed Twelve, and the fourth contract had not yet been made, did that conflict?

Not at all.

For his fifth Pet Beast, Xu Ran currently had only one requirement.

That was, it must not share the same Attribute with the other four.

Thus, his choices were narrowed down to water, fire, ice, wind, and light Attributes.

As for other requirements and directions, Xu Ran had none.

Perhaps looking at the Pet Beasts at the Breeding Base could bring him some inspiration.

With this thought, Xu Ran quickly made a decision to take the three little ones to have a look during today’s lunch break.

Using Contractual Sensing to convey his decision to the three little ones training diligently in the Training Area, Xu Ran quickly walked to the entrance of the Foster Shop, shouting to the long line of customers waiting outside.

"Next, please."

-----------------

"Chya?" (Did you hear what Xu Ran said? He’s going to take us to the Pet Beast Breeding Base at noon.)

The three little ones who had finished training walked out of the Training Area almost simultaneously. Cancan approached Ziyun and Star, lowering its voice sneakily and starting to talk.

"Meow~" (Xu Ran told me too. I think he’s probably planning to find our fifth member, right?)

Ziyun calmly licked its paw, but the occasional flicker of nervousness in its eyes still betrayed it.

No wonder it would think so. Although none of the three little ones came from a Pet Beast Breeding Base, they were all quite clear on what purpose a Breeding Base served.

"Xi Lu~" (What I’m worried about now, is if Twelve might become the fifth contracted.)

Star whinnied, its eyes showing a meaningful depth.

Xu Ran’s fourth contract slot was still vacant, and Twelve had yet to complete a contract. If a suitable fifth member was encountered, it was quite possible they could occupy the fourth contract slot.

In that case, who would be the fourth was really hard to say.

"Chya~" (That couldn’t be, right?)

Cancan scratched its head, muttering to itself in a low voice.

Ziyun remained silent, but its gaze towards Cancan held a hint of strangeness.

Based on the order of acquisition, Cancan should have been Xu Ran’s second Pet Beast.

However, at that time, Cancan was still in its egg and unable to contract, so the second beast Xu Ran contracted was Star.

In a sense, Star’s concern might very well become a reality.

The three little ones, chatting back and forth, both looked forward to having a new fifth member and worried about Twelve, far away in Beast Field 97.

Soon, they appeared together in the shop.

As soon as they reached the shop, Xu Ran jokingly smacked each beast on the head and spoke with a mix of laughter and helplessness, "What nonsense are you all thinking? I’m just going for a look, not necessarily to find the fifth Pet Beast right away."

"Moreover, the fourth contract slot is reserved for Twelve, and even if we really find a suitable fifth member, that decision won’t change."

Although he hadn’t heard the three little ones’ conversation directly, Xu Ran, through Contractual Sensing, had clearly sensed their thoughts.

"Meow~" (I was wrong~)

Ziyun touched its head, embarrassed at the spot where Xu Ran had just knocked.

It was the first to speculate that Xu Ran was looking for a fifth Pet Beast.

"Xi Lu~" (I was also mistaken.)

Star whinnied, likewise looking a bit embarrassed.

It was the one guessing Xu Ran might contract the fifth beast first.

"Alright, this time we’re just going to see what a Pet Beast Breeding Base looks like, to do a field inspection. They are our clients, after all." Xu Ran explained Song Xuan’s request to the three little ones simply, "Anyway, looking at the Pet Beasts is just by the way."

The three little ones nodded in understanding.

So that’s what it was!

With the misunderstanding cleared up, Xu Ran picked up Ziyun and Cancan, hopped onto Star’s back, and quickly set off from the shop.

The Green Bud Pet Beast Breeding Base was far from unknown within Bright Radiance City.

After asking a few passersby and following the navigation, Xu Ran quickly found its exact location and soon arrived.

Looking at the sprawling base’s entrance, with the words "Green Bud Pet Beast Breeding Base" prominently displayed along with the emblem of tender green sprouts, Xu Ran nodded slightly.

It looked quite decent.

The base’s entrance gate was bustling with Beast Masters going in and out. Some looked very young and were accompanied by their parents, their faces full of excitement, likely young Beast Masters about to make their first Pet Beast contract.

With so many people entering the base, the business of Green Bud Pet Beast Breeding Base must be doing well.

However, Xu Ran shook his head slightly at the sight of the situation at another exit of the base.

Not one person leaving the base had a Pet Beast by their side.
