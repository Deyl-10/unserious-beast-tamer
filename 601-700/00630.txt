Chapter 630 - 319: The Deep Slumber Bird!_3

```

The next moment, the Nightmare Beast King slashed one of its wings against the other, leaving a fierce wound, and then peeled off a droplet of blood surging with rich blue and purple light, causing it to float in front of Xu Ran.

Superpower-tier King Level Blood Essence.

With this, all the evolution materials for Twelve had been gathered.

A look of astonishment immediately appeared on Xu Ran’s face.

He had originally thought to gather all the materials Twelve needed quickly after forming the contract, but he hadn’t expected the Nightmare Beast King to have already completed this step ahead of time.

And the surprises the Nightmare Beast King had for Xu Ran didn’t stop there.

"I have already conquered Beast Field No. 97 and can summon tens of thousands of wild Transcendent Beings at any time to perform mass hypnosis, meeting the requirements for Twelve’s Evolution Ritual," the Nightmare Beast King said to Xu Ran, pausing slightly.

"Now, can I upgrade Twelve’s Talent Skills?" Equally flabbergasted was Twelve, nestled in Xu Ran’s arms.

That’s not right?

This isn’t right!

Since when did Star also master Four Stars Skills?

The skill Ziyun had just used didn’t seem to be the Immortal Body it had before, right?

How long had it been since they last saw each other, and they already have new Four Stars Skills?

In an instant, Twelve felt a new grievance against its ’dear dad’ welling up.

If it hadn’t been snatched away by its ’dear dad,’ maybe it would also have Four Stars Skills by now!

It then turned its gaze towards Cancan, who was stepping forward.

This guy, he wouldn’t have a new Four Stars Skill, too, would he?

The next moment, Twelve found some comfort from Cancan’s performance.

Thank goodness, the Four Stars Skill Cancan mastered was still the same one from before.

Once the three little ones had all finished showcasing, Xu Ran once again met the gaze of the Nightmare Beast King, "Elder, may I now form a contract with Twelve?"

The Nightmare Beast King fell silent briefly.

Having witnessed all three King Species Pet Beasts displaying Four Stars Skills, its old notions had been severely shaken.

Undoubtedly, for Xu Ran, who could elevate Three Star Skills to Four Stars, raising Two Stars Skills to Three Stars would be even simpler.

"Yes." Finally, the Nightmare Beast King nodded.

"Yip!" (Great!) Cancan couldn’t help but cheer aloud.

Infected by its enthusiasm, Ziyun and Star also cheered in unison.

Seeing the three little ones’ excited antics, Xu Ran smiled, and then pulled forth the fourth contract slot that had been vacant for a long time, quickly forming a contract with Twelve in his arms.

[Host: Xu Ran

Contract Power: Fourth Stage

Contract Pet Beasts:

Ziyun [View Details]

Star [View Details]

Cancan [View Details]

Twelve [View Details]

...]

Looking at the updated personal panel in front of him, Xu Ran casually clicked to open Twelve’s panel.

[Contract Pet Beast: Twelve

Race Name: Velvet Sparrow

Attribute: Super ability

Growth Step: Elite Stage (20000/20000)

Race Stage: Leader Species

Skills:

[★★Order of No Conquest (Full Moon Level)] (0/10000)

[★★Illusory Scenery (Full Moon Level)] (0/10000) [+]@@novelbin@@

[★★Shadow of Deterrence (Waning Moon Level)] (968/2000) [+]

[★★Soul Shatter Roar (Waning Moon Level)] (122/2000) [+]

[★Mind Induction (Waning Moon Level)] (312/2000) [+]]

It was clear that during their separation, Twelve had not been inactive.

It had not only acquired a second Full Moon Level skill but had also raised its Soul Shatter Roar from Starlight Level to Waning Moon Level.

With that, the requirements for evolution proficiency were completely satisfied.

The only thing missing was to upgrade its Talent Skills.

"Chirp~" (I’ve finally waited for this day!) Twelve also cheered, but quickly noticing its father’s unusual gaze, it promptly became well-behaved again.

With a sigh in his heart, the Nightmare Beast King looked towards Xu Ran and suddenly flapped its wing.

One after another, resources appeared before Xu Ran.

Dreamer’s Shadow, Dream Weaving Silkworm Silk, Fantasy Crystals, Life Dewdrop, Transcendence Flower.

With just one glance, Xu Ran recognized these as the resources needed for Twelve’s evolution.
