Chapter 687 - 334: Starfire Foster Shop In Xuanxing City, Grand Opening!_2

Cancan and Twelve’s evolution was equally unhurried.

One had just started to prepare, while the other had not even acquired an evolution path and certainly couldn’t evolve in the short term.

The arrival of two figures into the shop interrupted Xu Ran’s reverie.

Seeing that a customer had finally come, Xu Ran put down his teacup and skillfully revealed a polite and friendly smile, "Welcome~"

"Hello, how much does it cost to foster pets in your shop?" Tang Mu, entering the storefront, approached Xu Ran and got straight to the point.

"Foster care?" A flicker of surprise passed through Xu Ran’s eyes.

It seemed that this time, the store’s first deal might not be for Washing and Protection.

"You can look at the Price Menu behind you," Xu Ran suggested.

"Alright." Tang Mu nodded slightly and then turned around. Upon clearly seeing the rows of prices, a look of surprise crossed his face, but he remained silent.

On the other hand, Zhou Yong, who had come with Tang Mu, immediately expressed his doubt, "Your foster care rates are almost two to three times higher than other shops. Are you kidding?"

"Sir, the service determines the price," Xu Ran said with a smile. "After you see our foster environment, I believe you will have a new view of this price."

"No service justifies that price!" Zhou Yong rolled his eyes, showing no inclination to even glance at the foster environment due to Xu Ran’s words, "Tang Mu, let’s just go."

He had already branded the store known as Starfire Foster as a "Black Shop."

However, upon hearing the words "service determines the price," a look of intrigue appeared in Tang Mu’s eyes.

His personality had a stubborn and earnest side. Rather than following hearsay, he trusted his own eyes more.

That’s why, after learning from Zhou Yong that Pingtian Foster offered the best foster service in Xuanxing City, he didn’t immediately decide and instead dragged Zhou Yong around to inspect every foster shop big and small in Xuanxing City, before eventually choosing to foster at Pingtian Foster Shop.

And now, Xu Ran’s words had moved him.

After several days of effort, all he sought was the best care for his Pet Beast. If the young owner’s words were true, then the service here might indeed be exceptional.

"Zhou Yong, let’s take a look at the foster environment first," Tang Mu said without hesitation.

"Hey, you." Zhou Yong, who had already stepped one foot out of the shop, wore a resigned look and silently stepped back in, "Fine, let’s take a look."

"Please, this way," Xu Ran said with a smile, simultaneously letting out a sigh of relief.

Fortunately, the shop’s first deal had not fallen through.

As for the possibility that the two would opt not to choose Starfire Foster after inspecting the foster environment, Xu Ran had not even considered it.

From the first shop in Qingzhou City to now, there had never been a case where someone did not choose Starfire Foster after seeing the foster environment.

This was the source of his confidence.

Under Xu Ran’s lead, they soon arrived at an expansive, boundless wasteland.

"Wow, it’s so big? This must use Space Expansion Technology, right?" Zhou Yong’s eyes widened, astonishment etched on his face from Xu Ran’s grand gesture, "Is all this space used for fostering?"

"Yes," Xu Ran nodded with a smile. "At this moment, all of the area you see is used for fostering space. But since it’s the shop’s first day opening, there are no residents, so it seems a bit desolate."

"It is indeed quite desolate," Tang Mu agreed seriously.

Though he was also taken aback by Xu Ran’s grand gesture, his greater concern for his Pet Beast’s quality of life quickly led him to spot the shortcomings here.

The environment was too monotonous.

Only Pet Beasts with an Earth attribute would probably adapt to such a terrain and geomorphology.

And the Pet Beast he wanted to foster was not of the Earth attribute.

"A vast space is good, but a monotonous environment won’t do," Tang Mu shook his head. "Do you only have this kind of foster environment?"

"No, you are mistaken, sir," Xu Ran shook his head. "Here is the undeveloped Foster area. We will customize the exclusive activity and living areas according to the actual Pet Beasts being fostered."

"Have you ever heard of ’simulated environments’?"

"That’s how it is," Tang Mu nodded in understanding.

If that were the case, he could accept it.

The Hexagram Star Array flickered behind Tang Mu, and soon a huge figure emerged from the storm.

It was a Human-shaped Pet Beast, standing over ten meters tall, with green fur and mane all over its body, holding a bone rod in its hand and exuding a fierce aura.

Wind attribute King Species, the Wind Roar Beast.

After summoning the Pet Beast he intended to foster, Tang Mu looked towards Xu Ran again, "Could you customize the activity area for my Wind Roar Beast as you mentioned?"@@novelbin@@

"I want to see the effect of the customization you talked about."

"Certainly."

Xu Ran nodded, took out the Control hub, and after inquiring in detail about the Wind Roar Beast’s preferences and habits, a space exclusively for it was constructed before everyone’s eyes.

"Whoa!"

The Wind Roar Beast let out a cheer, dashed into it in a flash, and roamed through the sea of wind with a look of complete satisfaction on its face.

Clearly, it liked the environment here.

And Tang Mu, who felt the Contractual Sensing with the Wind Roar Beast, could sense that such emotion was something the Wind Roar Beast had never had in the previous inspections.

Zhou Yong was equally agape.

"This huge area, all for the Wind Roar Beast?" He took in a breath of cold air, envy evident on his face.

In an ordinary foster shop, perhaps this whole area would be the extent of the foster area, but here, such a vast space was dedicated to a single Pet Beast.
