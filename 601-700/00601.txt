Chapter 601 - 312: Slaying The Bat King!_2

"Ziyun!"@@novelbin@@

"Meow!" (I’m here!)

Ziyun, already taut with anticipation from the star’s warning, responded. Then, in a swift motion, his slender body transformed into a longsword with a white-purple hue that seemed capable of slicing through the void.

Four Star Skill, Halo Level – Immortal Body!

"Xi Lu Lu~"

Star let out a spirited neigh, as starlight converged from the void, twisting into invisible chains, linking it with Xu Ran. In an instant, the bond between person and pet fused, and their power began to surge up like a rocket, climbing higher and higher!

Three Star Skill, Halo Level – Fated Star Pulling!

And yet, this wasn’t all!

Amidst the intertwining darkness and bright starlight, layers upon layers of splendorous glow, reminiscent of the celestial dome, showered around Star and Xu Ran, catapulting their power once more to explosive heights!

Four Star Skill, Halo Level – Prayer of Starry Night!

Having reached the peak of his strength, Xu Ran let out a low shout and grabbed the longsword that Ziyun had become, a sharp glint flashing in his eyes.

His aura became profound and piercing in an instant, and at the tip of the longsword, the radiance appeared sharp enough to pierce the skies!

"Cha!" (Leave the clearing to me!)

Cancan let out a low cry, a majestic earthen-yellow halo swirling around him, then unfurled like a tempest, sweeping across the land and spreading toward the distance.

His body quickly grew larger, stopping short of continuous enlargement but returning to his original size, standing like a small mountain, firmly guarding by Xu Ran’s side.

Nodding at Cancan and gazing at the increasingly distinct figures in the void, Xu Ran took a deep breath and then swung the longsword without hesitation!

"Clang!!!"

A clear ring of the sword shattered the silence of the night!

A sword shadow, with a blade of concentrated lightning and a body as dark and profound as the night sky, tore the heavens asunder, viciously aimed at the unprepared Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King!

This night, a frightful encounter! A flicker of anticipation passed through the eyes of the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King.

Having been on guard against the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow for over a year, it knew the other’s abilities like the back of its hand, now fighting a life-and-death battle, it calculated about a sixty percent chance of victory.

So, it would surely have the last laugh.

It had already planned that after taking the Extinct Thunder Attraction, it would lead its race to migrate once again, seeking a remote and safe place to focus on evolving into the Emperor Species.

This Legion Field No. 47 should finally hear the voice of the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King!

"Squeak~~"

I won’t come back for the next two months.

Looking at his wife, the queen of the race, the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King said so.

The last two months were of the utmost importance, not a time for carelessness.

In the eyes of the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat Queen, there was reluctance, but she also understood how crucial that resource was to her husband and their entire race.

After several murmured advices and blessings, the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat Queen watched as the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King departed, then led the main body of the Thunder Sound Bat Race back home.

"Xi Lu!" (I’m here!)

Star let out a passionate neigh, echoing in the empty valley amid the pitch-black night.

Its eyes, now completely turned pure black with mysterious chains tangled within, gazed from afar at a tiny spot rapidly growing larger at the edge of heaven, a strange gleam flickering in its gaze.

Three Star Skill, Halo Level – Night Inspection.

This skill, having evolved and improved, now had multiple uses, but that didn’t hinder its original purpose of enhancing vision.

In the darkness of night, it always served as Star’s most advantageous surveillance method.

"Hmm?"

Xu Ran, deep in meditation, suddenly opened his eyes and glanced in the direction of Star’s gaze. Without any hesitation, he leaped from the large rock where he was sitting cross-legged onto Star’s back.

"Ziyun!"

"Meow!" (I’m here!)

Ziyun, already taut with anticipation from the star’s warning, responded. Then, in a swift motion, his slender body transformed into a longsword with a white-purple hue that seemed capable of slicing through the void.
