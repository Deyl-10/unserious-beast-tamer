Chapter 602 - 312: Slaying The Bat King!_3

A clear and piercing sound of a blade shattered the night’s silence!@@novelbin@@

A blade shadow, its edge formed of thunder gathered to the utmost extreme and its body the profound and dark night sky, ripped through the heavens, slashing viciously at the unsuspecting Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King!

This night, souls were startled! A hint of anticipation flickered in the eyes of the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King.

After being on guard against the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow for over a year, the bat king was confident in its understanding of its opponent’s abilities, and now facing a life-and-death struggle, it had about a sixty percent chance of victory.

So, it was certain it would have the last laugh.

It had already decided that after taking away the Extinct Thunder Attraction, it would lead its race to migrate again to a remote and safe place to wholeheartedly attempt evolving into an Emperor Species.

This Beast Field No. 47 ought to have the voice of the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King!

"Squeak~~"

I won’t be coming back for the next two months.

Gazing at his wife, the queen of the race, the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King thus spoke.

The last two months were of utmost importance, allowing no room for negligence.

In the eyes of the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat Queen lingered reluctance, but it understood just as well how vital that resource was for its husband and the entire race.

After chatting incessantly with a few words of caution and blessing, the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat Queen watched the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King leave, then led the large troop of the Thunder Sound Bat Race back.

"Xi Lu!" (He’s here!)

Star issued an exuberant neigh, echoing through the empty valley in the pitch-black night.

Its eyes, now transformed into pure black with mysterious chains intertwined within, stared distantly at a small dot rapidly enlarging at the edge of the sky, flashing with a strange light.

Three Star Skill, Halo Level・Night Inspection.

This skill, with its fusion and enhancement, now possessed many uses, yet this did not hinder its original purpose of enhancing visual acuity.

In the darkness of night, it was always Star’s most advantageous monitoring tool.

"Hm?"

Xu Ran, who was deep in meditation, abruptly opened his eyes and glanced in the direction of Star’s gaze, then unhesitatingly leaped from the large stone where he was seated cross-legged onto Star’s back.

"Ziyun!"

"Meow!" (He’s here!)

Ziyun, already tensed and ready to spring at Star’s warning, responded with a sound and then its aura shifted rapidly, its slender body transforming into a white-purple longsword that seemed capable of slicing through the void.

Four Star Skill, Halo Level・Immortal Body!

"Xi Lu Lu~"

Star neighed, and starlight converged from the void, tangling into invisible chains linking itself with Xu Ran, instantly merging the aura of man and pet into one, their power skyrocketing in a moment like a rocket!

Three Star Skill, Halo Level・Fated Star Pulling!

And yet, there was more!

Amidst the intertwining darkness profound and the bright starlight, layers of splendor as magnificent as the starry sky cascaded around Star and Xu Ran, propelling their power to surge once again!

Four Star Skill, Halo Level・Prayer of Starry Night!

With his strength at its peak, Xu Ran let out a low shout and grabbed Ziyun in its longsword form, a sharp light emerging in his eyes.

His aura in that instant turned deep and sharp, and at the tip of the longsword, the light transformed into a blade edge that seemed capable of piercing the sky!

"Cha!" (Leave the clean-up to me!)

Cancan let out a low bark, and a tremendous earthy yellow halo surged around him, then swept out like raging waves, extending towards the distance.

His body rapidly enlarged, not continuing to grow massive, but reverting to its original body type like a small hill, steadfastly guarding Xu Ran’s side!

Nodding toward Cancan and eyeing the figure becoming clearer in the void, Xu Ran took a deep breath and then, without any hesitation, swung the longsword!

"Zeng!!!!"

A clear and piercing sound of a blade shattered the night’s silence!

A blade shadow, its edge formed of thunder gathered to the utmost extreme and its body the profound and dark night sky, ripped through the heavens, slashing viciously at the unsuspecting Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King!
