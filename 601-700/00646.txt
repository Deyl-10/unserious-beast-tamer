Chapter 646 - 323 Psychiatrist Twelve_3

The next moment, she walked to the sofa on her own, lay down, closed her eyes, and quickly fell into a dream.

Twelve pulled an invisible thread from Zong Ru’s body, then flapped its wings and hovered in the air above her.

The light in its sea-blue eyes swirled, and where its gaze landed, Zong Ru’s body underwent a peculiar transformation, becoming like a transparent container, inside which was a rotating mass of gray-black mist.

Having witnessed countless dreams during the Evolution Ritual, Twelve knew very well that such a color of mist signified that Zong Ru was currently experiencing a nightmare.

It connected to her through heartbeats and entered Zong Ru’s nightmare the next moment.

-----------------

"No… don’t come near me!"

Zong Ru screamed, sprinting down the empty and quiet street with relentless speed, while two vicious figures closely pursued her from behind.

One of them was already torn apart, and from its ruined body, one could vaguely discern that it was a wolf-type pet beast.

This torn physique had not lost the ability to move in Zong Ru’s dream; every ripped part of its body was filled with fierce claws, giving it numerous feet and rapid movement.

Moreover, mouths full of sharp teeth emitted ferocious and terrifying howls, instilling fear in anyone who heard them.

The other monster was equally dreadful, if not more so.

It was covered in indistinct blood, with bits of entrails and shredded flesh that seemed to come from nowhere, exuding a dreadful stench before it even drew close, making it as terrifying as a devil.

Being chased by such two horrifying monsters, Zong Ru’s expression twisted from sheer terror; she kept running but could not escape the pursuit of the monsters behind her.

A sense of despair spread throughout the dream.

When Twelve appeared in the dream, what it saw was the scene before its eyes.

The figure covered in blood and visceral fragments, though monstrously modified due to the dream’s influence, could still be roughly made out to be the Silver Hair King.

Seeing Zong Ru’s expression of utter fear, Twelve sighed softly, then spread its wings.

The next moment, the entire dream started to fracture like a broken mirror, cracks appearing throughout until it dissolved into countless bubbles and vanished.

As the previous scene dissipated, the surroundings quickly changed.

On the empty streets, blurry figures began to emerge, along with the sounds of hawking and the fragrance of various foods mixing together.

The only clear presence in the field was Zong Ru and the tall Silver Hair King behind her.

The two of them walked down the street, and at this moment, Zong Ru showed no fear of the Silver Hair King, even occasionally chatting cheerfully with it.

Twelve watched all of this quietly.

It knew that all dreams are anchored in real memories, and what it was seeing now were the actual memories entwined with Zong Ru’s nightmare.

This was the unique power of the Sleeping bird, the instinct born from evolving by absorbing the dreams of ten thousand beings.

The memory continued, and a pet beast resembling a wolf-dog crossed the street and approached Zong Ru and the Silver Hair King.

Facing this unfamiliar pet beast, Zong Ru still showed little guard.

But behind her, the Silver Hair King’s gaze quickly became wary.

Being of the Fighting Attribute, it sensed a dangerous aura emanating from the other creature.

"Do you want to eat my candy apple?" Zong Ru asked cheerfully, offering the candy apple in her hand, "Here, it’s for you."

At that moment, a sudden transformation occurred.

The wolf-type pet beast’s eyes turned blood red instantly, and it let out a vicious roar, about to pounce on Zong Ru.

With both being in such close proximity, it seemed inevitable that Zong Ru would be torn to shreds, but a roar just as fierce came from behind her.

The already alert Silver Hair King sprang into action.

The moment the wolf-type pet beast made a move against Zong Ru, the Silver Hair King unhesitatingly classified it as an enemy.

And an enemy was to be deterred with the strongest show of force!@@novelbin@@

Without hesitation, it shielded Zong Ru, knocking the assailant flying with a swipe of its paw, then rushing forward to fight it.

The battle between the two pet beasts was extremely brutal, but ultimately the Silver Hair King emerged victorious at the cost of numerous injuries, viciously tearing the wolf-type pet beast apart and allowing its blood to drench its body.

This was the Silver Hair King’s way of showcasing its valor, but it had not anticipated how horrifying such a bloody sight could be for a little girl grown in a greenhouse.

In shock and confusion, Zong Ru passed out.

When she awoke once more, this overwhelming scene haunted her night and day like a terrible nightmare.

The snippet of memory abruptly ended, and in the dark space, only Zong Ru remained, sitting down with her arms wrapped around her knees, burying her head deeply between them.

Twelve flapped its wings and gently settled on Zong Ru’s shoulder.

In the darkness, it emitted a clear and melodious chirp.

"Chirp~"

The next moment, daylight broke.

Around them, colorful fairy-tale-like castles appeared, and in front of Zong Ru materialized the Silver Hair King, previously covered in filth from the nightmare.

With the help of various adorable creatures, the Silver Hair King cleaned its dirty body and dressed in a nice coat.

It danced with the lovely creatures, and in the end, extended its broad hand to Zong Ru.

Ultimately, Zong Ru and the Silver Hair King danced together in the light and cheerful music.
