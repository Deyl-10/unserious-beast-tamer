Chapter 645 - 323 Psychiatrist Twelve_2

Just at that moment, an abrupt change occurred.

The eyes of the wolf-type pet beast suddenly turned blood red, and it let out a ferocious roar, poised to pounce on Zong Ru.

The distance between them was perilously close, and Zong Ru seemed about to be torn apart by the beast when an equally ferocious roar came from behind her.

The Silver Hair King, already on guard, took action.

At the moment the wolf-type pet beast made a move against Zong Ru, the Silver Hair King immediately categorized it as an enemy without hesitation.

And enemies needed to be deterred with the most powerful show of force!

It stepped in front of Zong Ru without hesitation, flinging its opponent away with a palm strike, then rushed forward to engage in combat.

The battle between the two pet beasts was exceptionally brutal, but ultimately, the Silver Hair King, at the cost of sustaining multiple injuries, killed its adversary. It savagely tore the wolf-type pet beast apart, letting its blood cover its body.

This was the Silver Hair King’s way of demonstrating its valor, but it had not anticipated how horrifying such a bloody scene would be for a little girl who had grown up in a greenhouse.

In terror and confusion, Zong Ru fainted.

When she woke again, the immensely shocking image haunted her like a nightmare, day and night.

The memory halted abruptly, and within the dark space, only Zong Ru remained, sitting with her knees drawn up and her head buried deep between them.

Twelve flapped its wings and gently landed on Zong Ru’s shoulder.

In the darkness, it let out a clear and melodious chirping sound.

"Chirp~"

The next moment, day broke.

Surrounding her appeared a fairy-tale-like, colorful castle, and in front of Zong Ru, the nightmare’s bloody Silver Hair King emerged.

With the help of cute creatures, the Silver Hair King washed away the filth from its body and put on a handsome coat.

Together with those endearing little creatures, it danced, eventually extending its large hand towards Zong Ru.@@novelbin@@

In the end, Zong Ru and the Silver Hair King danced together amidst the light and cheerful music.

A Three Star Skill, Halo Level: Flawless Illusion Realm.

Watching his creation, Twelve nodded in satisfaction, flapped its wings again, and consciousness returned to reality.

It chirped at the girl lying on the couch, lost in dreams, with a slight smile on her lips. The next moment, Zong Ru, immersed in the Endless Sleep, was awakened.

The girl sat up somewhat dazedly but soon her gaze became clear.

She looked around anxiously as if searching for something, and when her gaze fell on the Silver Hair King hiding behind her father, it paused quietly.

In the next instant, she screamed and jumped up, and, under the stupefied gaze of Mr. and Mrs. Zong, rushed over to the Silver Hair King, her small body stretching wide to embrace it tightly.

The Silver Hair King stood frozen in place, its eyes—strikingly similar to a human’s—filled with astonishment and disbelief.

Its body trembled violently as its large hands carefully touched Zong Ru, then gently wrapped around her petite frame.

It had been too long since it last felt such a warm and familiar embrace.

Mrs. Zong, looking at the large and small figure embracing each other, instantly felt her eyes redden as tears slid down her cheeks.

Even Mr. Zong couldn’t help wiping the dampness from the corners of his eyes.

Before that incident, Zong Ru was the one in the family who loved the Silver Hair King the most; the large and the small were almost inseparable.

But after that incident, everything changed.

Now, seeing a scene they hadn’t seen in a long time, the couple’s feelings were indescribable.

"Chirp~" (I did well, didn’t I?)

Twelve, having completed its task, flew onto Xu Ran’s shoulder, its face full of anticipation for praise.

"You did great," Xu Ran said, seriously, as he stroked Twelve’s head.

"Knock knock knock~"

Accompanied by a series of somewhat dull knocks, the door quickly opened from the inside.

The opener was a girl who looked about seven or eight years old, dressed in a cute princess dress, seemingly ready to go out and have fun.

"Daddy!" Seeing Mr. Zong outside the door, the girl’s face immediately lit up with a brilliant smile, and she quickly flung herself at him. But when she saw the somewhat evasive figure behind Mr. Zong, her face quickly turned pale.

As the terrifying scene from half a year ago flashed through her mind, the girl screamed and quickly backed away.

At the sound, Mrs. Zong rushed over and swiftly embraced the girl, patting her back to comfort her. Upon seeing the Silver Hair King, her expression turned displeased, "Husband?"

"I’ve decided to let the Silver Hair King move back in with us," Mr. Zong entered the house with a serious face, "It’s not happy outside, and it did nothing wrong in that incident. If it weren’t for it, Ru might not be alive today."

"I know, but Ru is very scared, and she will continue to have nightmares with the Silver Hair King in the house," Mrs. Zong said helplessly.

"Regarding this matter, please let my pet beast help," Xu Ran, who had entered the Zong Family home alongside Mr. Zong, said with a smile.

"Who are you?" Mrs. Zong noticed Xu Ran, who had come in with her husband, for the first time.

"This is Xu Ran, the owner of the Foster Shop where the Silver Hair King is currently staying," Mr. Zong introduced, "He has a pet beast that can help Ru."

"If you don’t mind, please let me give it a try," Xu Ran touched Twelve, perched on his shoulder, and spoke softly.

"This..." Mrs. Zong hesitated but then slowly released her daughter from her embrace after exchanging a look with her husband, "Please, it’s a trouble."

Zong Ru, who had been sobbing, also heard the earlier conversation. She wiped away her tears and slowly stood up.
