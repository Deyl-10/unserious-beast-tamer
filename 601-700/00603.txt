"Hmm?"

Xu Ran, who was deep in meditation, suddenly opened his eyes and glanced in the direction of the stars’ gaze without a moment’s hesitation, then leaped from the large boulder where he sat cross-legged onto Star’s back.

"Ziyun!"

"Meow!" (Coming!)

Ziyun, whose body had already tensed at Star’s warning, responded. Then, with its aura quickly changing, its slender body transformed into a white and purple longsword that seemed capable of slicing through the void.

"Xi Lu Lu~"

Star let out a neigh as starlight gathered from the void, intertwining into invisible chains that linked it with Xu Ran. In an instant, master and pet’s auras fused as one, and their power skyrocketed as if on a rocket, climbing by leaps and bounds!

And it wasn’t over yet!

As the profound darkness and bright starlight interwove and flickered, layer upon layer of resplendent light, like a starry dome, showered down beside Star and Xu Ran, pushing their power to surge once again!

Four Star Skill, Halo Level·Prayer of Starry Night!

Xu Ran, having elevated his strength to its peak, let out a low shout, raised his hand, and grabbed the longsword that Ziyun had transformed into, his eyes shimmering with a sharp light.

His aura became profound and keen in an instant, the tip of the longsword radiating a glow that seemed capable of piercing the heavens!

"Cha!" (Leave the clearing to me!)

Cancan let out a low shout, and a majestic earthy-yellow halo surged around him. Then, like raging waves, it swept across the land and spread towards the distance.

His body swiftly enlarged. Although he did not continue to grow massive, he returned to his original size, standing like a small mountain firm beside Xu Ran!

Xu Ran nodded at Cancan and, gazing at the gradually materializing figures in the void, took a deep breath and then slashed with the longsword without any hesitation!

"Zeng!!!"

The clear sound of the blade cleaved through the silence of the night!

A blade shadow that had gathered the pinnacle of thunder as its edge and the dark, profound night sky as its body tore through the heavens, ruthlessly slashing towards the unsuspecting Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King!

This night was startling. A glint of anticipation flashed in the eyes of the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King.

Having kept a wary eye on the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow for over a year, the Bat King knew his opponent’s capabilities as well as the back of his hand. Now, facing life-or-death combat, he saw a sixty percent chance of victory.

So, he was sure to be the one to laugh last.

He had already planned. Once he secured the Extinct Thunder Attraction, he would lead his race on another migration, to a remote and safe place to earnestly attempt evolution into an Emperor Species.

It was time for Beast Field #47 to hear the voice of the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King!

"Squee~~"

I won’t be coming back for the next two months.

Looking at his wife, the queen of his race, thus spoke the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King.

The last two months were critical, allowing no room for error.

The eyes of the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat Queen held reluctance, but she understood how crucial that resource was to her husband and to their entire race.

After rambling on with several words of caution and blessings, the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat Queen watched as the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King left, then led the bulk of the Thunder Sound Bat Race back.

"Xi Lu!" (Coming!)

Star let out a fervent neigh that echoed through the empty valley in the pitch-black night.

Its eyes, now completely turned pure black with mysterious chains entwined within, stared at a rapidly enlarging point on the horizon, twinkling with a strange light.

"Hmm?"

While meditating, Xu Ran suddenly opened his eyes and glanced in the direction of the starlight. Without hesitation, he leapt from the large stone where he was sitting cross-legged onto the back of Star.

"Ziyun!"@@novelbin@@

"Meow!" (I’m here!)

Ziyun, already tense and ready at the warning of Star, responded and then his aura rapidly changed. His slender body shook and transformed into a longsword that seemed capable of slicing through the void, its white and purple glow shining brightly.

"Xi Lu Lu~"

Star neighed as starlight gathered from the void, intertwining into invisible chains connecting it to Xu Ran. In an instant, master and pet’s auras fused into one, their strength soaring as if riding on a rocket, climbing higher with each second!

Raising his strength to its peak, Xu Ran let out a low shout and grasped the longsword that Ziyun had become, his eyes flashing with a sharp glint.

His aura became deep and edged in an instant, with the tip of the sword shining so brightly it seemed to pierce the heavens!

"Cha!" (Leave the clean-up to me!)

Cancan roared lowly as a majestic earthy yellow halo surged around him, then swept across the land like raging waves, spreading towards the distance.

His body rapidly grew larger, not continuing to increase in size, but returning to its original body type, like a small mountain, firmly guarding Xu Ran’s side!

Nodding towards Cancan and looking at the increasingly distinct figures in the void, Xu Ran took a deep breath and then, without any hesitation, swung the longsword!

"Tzing!!!"

A clear and melodious sword cry shattered the silence of the night!

A blade shadow, formed by the ultimate convergence of thunder as the blade edge and the dark, profound night sky as the blade body, tore through the heavens, striking mercilessly at the unsuspecting Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King!

This night was filled with shock! A hint of anticipation flashed in the eyes of the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King.

After being on guard against the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow for over a year, it knew its opponent’s abilities like the back of its hand. The bat king believed it had a sixty percent chance of winning this life-or-death battle.

Therefore, it would surely be the last one laughing.

It had already planned that after taking the Extinct Thunder Attraction, it would lead its race to migrate again, to a secluded and safe place to focus on evolving into an Emperor Species.

This Beast Field number 47 should hear the voice of the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King!

"Squeak~~"

I won’t return for the next two months.

Looking at his wife, the Queen of his race, the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King spoke thus.

The last two months were of the utmost importance, brooking no negligence.

There was a tinge of reluctance in the eyes of the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat Queen, but she also understood the importance of that resource for her husband and for their entire race.

After muttering a few words of caution and blessing, the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat Queen watched the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King leave, then led the majority of the Thunder Sound Bat Race back.

"Xi Lu!" (It’s coming!)

Star let out an impassioned neigh that echoed through the empty valley in the pitch-black night.

Its eyes had turned completely black, with mysterious chains woven within, fixedly gazing at a fast-growing dot at the edge of the sky, shimmering with an unusual light.
