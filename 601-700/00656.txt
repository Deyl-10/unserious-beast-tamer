Chapter 656 Chapter 326 Giving Xieyun City A Bit Of A Shock

[Content to be added]

"Poison Fire Bear, huh..."

Receiving the firefly's answer, Xu Ran nodded his head without surprise.

The abilities of the Poison Fire Bear were indeed very similar to the firefly's abilities after its mutation. Evolving into this evolutionary route could bring out its characteristics to a greater extent.

"Then let's see what the Poison Fire Bear's evolution path requires," he laughed heartily and then, without further hesitation, chose the Poison Fire Bear.

As other evolution paths faded away one by one, the evolution route for the Poison Fire Bear finally unfolded before Xu Ran's eyes.

[Evolution Path: Fire Ear Bear (Fire) → Poison Fire Bear (Fire)

Evolution Difficulty: ★★★★★

Evolution Potential: ★★★★★

Evolution Conditions:

1. Fire Ear Bear has not broken through to the Leadership Stage

2. Fire Ear Bear's Talent Skills must be elevated to Three Star Skills before evolving

3. Other skills must reach Waning Moon Level proficiency, Undying Flame must reach Full Moon Level proficiency

Evolution Materials: Heart Burning Poisonous Flame Marrow (Main), Fire King Level Blood Essence (Main), Fire Purifying Stone (Main), Earth Core Fire Seed, Life Dewdrop, Transcendence Flower

(Missing Main Material guarantees failure of evolution. Absence of auxiliary materials reduces success rate of evolution.)

Evolution Ritual: Absorb a large amount of Fire Poison in the place where Heart Burning Poisonous Flame Marrow grows to complete the final evolution.]@@novelbin@@

After reviewing the entire evolution path from start to finish, Xu Ran touched his chin uncontrollably.

"This evolution path..."

"Luhou?" (Is it very hard?)

The firefly asked with concern.

At this moment, every move Xu Ran made affected its heart deeply.

"Not too difficult," Xu Ran shook his head.

Although the firefly's evolution conditions were a bit more stringent compared to the four little ones', including the normal skill upgrades and the specific demand for Undying Flame to reach Full Moon Level.

But to Xu Ran at this moment, it was not difficult to achieve; it could be considered trivial.

What intrigued him more was the firefly's evolution ritual.

It required the completion of evolution in the birthplace of the most important Main Material for Evolution, which meant that it wouldn't be quite right to exchange for the evolution material called Heart Burning Poisonous Flame Marrow through the usual channels of the Beast Master Association.

Preferably, acquiring this resource in its place of origin and then immediately carrying out the evolution would be best.

Soon, Xu Ran informed the firefly of all the requirements for evolution.

Hearing this somewhat distant evolution information, the firefly's head went blank.

Evolution seemed so difficult.

Watching the bewildered firefly, Twelve barely held back a laugh and extended its wings to pat its head.

"Chiu~" (Don't worry, it's not as difficult as you think.)

Once upon a time, it had felt the same upon hearing its own evolution path for the first time, as if it were unattainable.

However, it turned out that with Xu Ran, these things indeed weren't difficult.

"No need to rush." Xu Ran patted the firefly's head and smiled reassuringly, "You remember the training methods I taught you today, right?"

"Next, focus on training Undying Flame and try to improve the Skill Proficiency of Undying Flame as much as possible."

"As for the others, once I break through the Fifth Stage contract power and the contract is completed, the evolution will surely proceed smoothly."

"Luhou!" (No problem!)

The firefly nodded vigorously.

Anyway, training was all it took!

In the air, it waved its bear paws with vigor and was about to continue training. It felt the world spin the next moment and when it came to its senses, it realized it had appeared in the Foster area.

"You have already trained in the Fire Training Area for eight hours today, which is over the limit." Xu Ran smiled, "Balance work with rest, we'll continue tomorrow."

"Xi Lu~" (We'll include you in our training next time.)

Star let out a purring sound, its eyes carrying a hint of affection.

From now on, they would have one more hardworking little partner in their training sessions.

"Ziyun, check how much longer we have."

Standing on the scorched vegetation below, electrified by the dense Thunderforce in the air, Xu Ran stared at the flashing lightning in the sky and suddenly spoke.

"Mew~" (About five more days.)

Ziyun closed its eyes slightly, and after a sensing session, quickly provided the exact time when the Extinct Thunder Attraction would appear.

"Five days, huh..." Xu Ran's eyes were pensive, and after a moment he nodded, "Then there's still time."

"We should head back to Xieyun City."

Xu Ran turned his head, looking back at the four little ones.

It had been ten days since the last resource distribution.

During these ten days, the four little ones had fully digested the power from their last improvement, and their strength had significantly advanced.

Ziyun, after its own relentless efforts, had already upgraded its four skills to the Violent Sun Level proficiency. Now, only three skills were left needing just a few more Skill Points in the next distribution to fulfill the proficiency requirement for evolution.

And only the Thunder Shake Heavenly Sound skill, remaining to be enhanced to Three Stars, was set to be upgraded during the next resource allocation.

It was getting closer and closer to its evolution.

Following close behind was Star.

Although only two skills were raised to Four Stars, Star has always been the most diligent in training among the four little ones, not at all falling short in Skill Proficiency compared to Ziyun who had the most points added.

With steady progress, it had successively reached Violent Sun Level Proficiency in three skills over the past ten days, now catching up with Ziyun.

Cancan, seemingly motivated by Ziyun and Star's simultaneous proficiency breakthroughs, also intensified its training.

Its only Four Star Skill, Land of Destruction, had likewise achieved Violent Sun Level proficiency.
