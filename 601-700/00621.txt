Chapter 621 - 317 The Doubtful Nightmare Beast King_2

And such murmurs do not occur during a Pet Beast’s evolution.

The Nightmare Beast King’s breakthrough failure was incredibly fortunate, capturing a hint of secrets that happened to be closely related to the essence of evolution.

It gained a profound understanding of evolution.

As long as Twelve could provide more detailed information, it could easily identify contradictions and errors in the Evolution Path, thereby proving it to be nothing more than a human boy’s fabrications.

Seeing his father still full of disbelief, Twelve’s stubborn temper flared up instantly.

Since he had already led his father to deduce the truth, he might as well let him know that the Beast Master he chose was no ordinary one!

"Chirp!" (This Evolution Path is...)

Without much hesitation, Twelve spoke out the entire content of the Velvet Sparrow evolving into the Sleeping Bird’s Evolution Path.

As Twelve’s voice fell, an eerie silence enveloped the scene. Continue your saga on NovelBin.Côm@@novelbin@@

For the first time, the Nightmare Beast King’s expression showed a significant change.

To it, this Evolution Path seemed absurd.

Expecting a Leader Species to raise all Skills to Three Stars before evolving was as ridiculous as a fool’s dream.

From what it had gleaned from the mysterious murmurs, only the Holy Spirit Race could elevate Four Star Skills to Five Stars.

And that was not mere Star elevation but the integration of all Talent Skills into the Wheel of Life, essentially different.

Upgrading Skills is a characteristic of evolution, how could it be accomplished before evolving?

But just as the Nightmare Beast King was about to refute this Evolution Path and tell his daughter that it was undoubtedly flawed, it fell silent once more.

Aside from that point, the Evolution Path seemed flawlessly perfect, even awe-inspiringly so to it.

Whether it was the combination of Evolution Materials or the set-up of the Evolution Ritual, both felt impeccable.

"Hiss?" (So, that human Beast Master claims to have a stronger Velvet Sparrow Evolution Path than the Demon Hawk?)

Although forced to speak, Twelve’s words were laced with vagueness, but the clever Nightmare Beast King instantly distilled the key information.

The first thought that rushed to its mind was one of absurdity and disbelief.

As the de facto ruler of Beast Field No. 97, the Nightmare Beast King was not only active within its own domain but had also visited neighboring Beast King-level Beast Fields and even nearby Beast Emperor-level Beast Fields.

Its travels were aimed at searching for the Velvet Sparrow’s Evolution Path.

For wild Transcendent Beings, especially one as intelligent as the Nightmare Beast King, exchanging Evolution Paths with other species in different Beast Fields is a very effective way to refine one’s Evolution Path.

If it encountered other Velvet Sparrow tribes that evolved into Demon Hawks, it could compare the differences in their Evolution Paths and further optimize its own species’ Evolution Path.

If it encountered Velvet Sparrows with different evolutionary types, that would be even more auspicious, as this could give the species more evolutionary choices and possibilities.

After visiting nearby Beast Fields and making numerous comparisons, the Nightmare Beast King concluded that, for now, the Demon Hawk remained the strongest evolutionary form for the Velvet Sparrow tribe.

In such circumstances, its daughter suddenly told it of a stronger Evolution Path, and the source was merely a human boy from a 3 Level Town—how could it possibly believe that?

"Hiss~" (I think you have been deceived by that human.)

The Nightmare Beast King spoke gravely, its initially decent impression of Xu Ran plummeting at that moment.

Twelve, who had been vague and reluctant to let his father know the exact situation, became instantly indignant upon hearing these words.

"Chirp!" (Xu Ran is no deceiver!)

The Nightmare Beast King looked into Twelve’s defiant eyes and sighed internally.

"Hiss~" (He’s just a boy from a 3 Level Town, likely only half-understanding evolution, how could he possess such an Evolution Path?)

"Chirp!" (But Ziyun, Star, and Cancan all evolved successfully following the Evolution Path he provided!)

"Hiss?" (Are you referring to his three Pet Beasts?)

Hearing this, the Nightmare Beast King was slightly taken aback.

After being reminded by Twelve, it vaguely remembered that indeed, when it saw the opponent before, his three Pet Beasts had already completed their evolution.

This was relatively rare in a 3 Level Town.

Could it be that this human truly possessed some Evolution Paths, among them that of the Velvet Sparrow?

At this moment, the Nightmare Beast King’s original skepticism began to waver slightly.

However, it quickly shook its head as if recalling something.

"Hiss~" (They might be Pet Beast Species whose Evolution Paths are already mastered by humans, but the Velvet Sparrow is not among them.)

The Nightmare Beast King, having visited a Beast Emperor-level Beast Field, had seen the state of a Second Level Town.

It knew that compared to the small, fragile human cities of Beast Field No. 97, which could face destruction at the hands of a Beast King, Second Level Towns were nearly unshakable.

There, more powerful Beast Masters resided, along with some elements that did not exist in 3 Level Towns.

Those were the Evolution Paths for certain Pet Beasts that humans had mastered over generations.

Leveraging these Evolution Paths, powerful Beast Masters emerged frequently in Second Level Towns.

And the Nightmare Beast King, who sought to find and complete the Evolution Path for the Velvet Sparrow tribe, did not overlook the Evolution Paths held by humans.
