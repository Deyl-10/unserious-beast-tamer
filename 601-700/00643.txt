Chapter 643 - 322: The Trail Of The Sparrow Behind The Scenes_4

"Meow~" (Let’s first tell Xu Ran about this.)

Ziyun took a deep breath and used Contractual Sensing to reach out to the busy Xu Ran from afar.

Inside the washing and protection room, Xu Ran’s hands paused slightly while he was caring for the pet beast.

What do you mean?

Based on Twelve’s conjecture about the wild Transcendent Beings, could there be more than just the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow eyeing the Extinct Thunder Attraction?

He suddenly felt a headache coming on.

This could be troublesome.

Fortunately, Twelve also said it wasn’t absolute.

Whether they really exist needs to be investigated in person.

"Boss Xu? Is there something wrong with my pet beast?" asked the customer sitting nearby who had been intently watching Xu Ran’s movements, unable to restrain his curiosity as he saw Xu Ran pause.

Even the usually delighted pet beast threw a resentful glance his way.

Just get on with it!@@novelbin@@

"Ah, sorry," Xu Ran hurriedly apologized, refocusing his attention on the washing and protection at hand, and responded to the four little ones with Contractual Sensing.

"Tonight’s the move." After its contract with Xu Ran, this was its first operational target along with its friends.

It had to exert part of its own power!

In this respect, Twelve had an advantage that the other three did not possess.

It came from the Beast Field, from a group of wild Extraordinary Creatures.

It understood the group of wild Extraordinary Creatures better than Xu Ran and the other three small ones.

After pondering for a moment, Twelve suddenly spoke up.

"Chirp~" (If I’m not mistaken, the powerful being that discovered the Extinct Thunder Attraction isn’t just the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow.)

"Meow?" (There are others?)

Ziyun was startled and couldn’t help but ask, his expression growing much more solemn.

According to the information they had previously gathered, the Thunder Attribute Beast King guarding the Extinct Thunder Attraction was only the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow and the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King, the latter of which they had ambushed and successfully slain.

Logically, only the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow might pose a threat to them.

After hearing Ziyun’s doubts, Twelve shook its head slightly.

"Chirp~" (In the wild, an Extraordinary Creature that finds a resource useful yet unattainable will guard it; this is but one method.)

"Chirp~" (Besides, some after securing the safety of the resource will leave their mark and surveillance, then wait for their prey.)

(Generally, the latter is more dangerous than the former.)

(Because the latter also happens to be their hunting targets.)

"Xi Lu~" (Could this really be the case?)

Star whinnied, its expression becoming solemn as well upon hearing Twelve’s words.

If based on Twelve’s statement, then could it be that the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow and Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King were just forces out in the open, and that even more powerful Transcendent Beings, also eyeing the Extinct Thunder Attraction, might exist in the shadows?

"Meow~" (Is there a way to discover them?)

Ziyun grew anxious.

The unknown is the most terrifying.

Not knowing how many Beast Kings they’d have to battle in the upcoming struggle was causing him an anxiety that made it hard to sit still.

Fortunately, Twelve quickly provided a positive response.

"Chirp~" (There is a way.)

As the daughter of the Nightmare Beast King who had spent a long time with Beast Kings, Twelve was highly sensitive to the aura of the Beast King Level.

If it could visit Fallen Thunder Valley just once, it was confident it could confirm whether a powerful Beast King was coveting the Extinct Thunder Attraction and had left a mark.

"Cha!" (There’s no time to lose, let’s go tonight!)

Cancan shouted, its eyes filled with excitement.

It, Cancan the Explorer, was about to make a grand reappearance!

Fortunately, Twelve also said it wasn’t absolute.

Whether it truly existed needed to be verified by an actual investigation.

"Boss Xu? Is there a problem with my Pet Beast?" The customer, who sat nearby and intently watched Xu Ran’s movements, couldn’t help but ask when Xu Ran paused.

Even the delighted Pet Beast was casting a resentful glance at him at this moment.

Come on, keep going!

"Ah, sorry." Xu Ran quickly apologized, refocused on the task of cleaning and caring at hand, and simultaneously replied to the four little ones with Contractual Sensing.

"Tonight we take action." This was their first operation target since the contract with Xu Ran and his friends.

It must demonstrate a part of its power!

In this regard, Twelve had a distinct advantage that the other three little ones did not possess.

It came from the Beast Field, from the group of wild Extraordinary Creatures.

It knew wild Extraordinary Creature groups better than Xu Ran and the other three little ones.

After pondering for a moment, Twelve suddenly spoke up.

"Chirp~" (If I’m not mistaken, the powerful creature that has discovered the Extinct Thunder Attraction is probably not just the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow.)

"Meow?" (There are others?)

Ziyun was startled and couldn’t help but ask, and its expression also became much more solemn.

According to the information they had gathered earlier, the Thunder Beast King guarding the Extinct Thunder Attraction was only the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow and the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King. The latter had already been ambushed and successfully killed by them.

Logically, only the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow should pose a threat to them.

Hearing Ziyun’s doubts, Twelve shook its head slightly.

"Chirp~" (Out in the wild, if Extraordinary Creatures find a resource that is useful but cannot be immediately obtained, guarding it is just one method.)

"Chirp~" (Besides, there are those who, after ensuring the resource is safe, would leave their mark and surveillance measures, and then wait for prey.)

(Generally speaking, the latter are more dangerous than the former.)

(Because the former is also their hunting target.)

"Xi Lu~" (Could it really be that way?)

Star neighed, its expression growing solemn after hearing Twelve’s words.

If according to Twelve’s theory, were the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow and the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King just the visible forces, and could there possibly be one or even multiple Extraordinary Creatures stronger than these two, also eyeing the Extinct Thunder Attraction in the shadows?

"Meow~" (Then is there a way to detect them?)

Ziyun was somewhat anxious.

The unknown was the most terrifying thing.

Not knowing how many Beast Kings they would have to fight for the resource in the future made it feel a restless anxiety.

Fortunately, Twelve quickly gave an affirmative response.

"Chirp~" (There is a way.)

As the daughter of the Nightmare Beast King, who had long been around the Beast King, Twelve was very sensitive to the aura of the Beast King Level.

As long as it could make one trip to the Fallen Thunder Valley, it was confident that it could confirm whether a powerful Beast King was coveting the Extinct Thunder Attraction and had left a mark.

"Chat!" (No time to lose, let’s go tonight!)

Cancan shouted excitedly, its eyes brimming with excitement.

It, Cancan the Explorer, was about to return to the adventure!

"Meow~" (Let’s tell Xu Ran about this first.)

Ziyun took a deep breath and connected to the busy Xu Ran through Contractual Sensing.

In the cleaning and caring room, Xu Ran’s hands caring for the Pet Beast paused for a moment.

What does that mean?

Was Twelve suggesting that there might be more than one Beast King eyeing the Extinct Thunder Attraction, apart from the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow?

He suddenly felt a headache coming on.

This could be troublesome.

Fortunately, Twelve also said it wasn’t absolute.

Whether it truly existed needed to be verified by an actual investigation.

"Boss Xu? Is there a problem with my Pet Beast?" The customer, who sat nearby and intently watched Xu Ran’s movements, couldn’t help but ask when Xu Ran paused.

Even the delighted Pet Beast was casting a resentful glance at him at this moment.

Come on, keep going!

"Ah, sorry." Xu Ran quickly apologized, refocused on the task of cleaning and caring at hand, and simultaneously replied to the four little ones with Contractual Sensing.

"Tonight we take action."
