Chapter 622 - 317: The Doubtful Nightmare Beast King_3

It relied on ambushing human Beast Masters and used superpower means to search their memories, effectively determining that humans had not yet mastered the Evolution Path of the Velvet Sparrow.@@novelbin@@

Even if they had, it would be nothing more than a rudimentary and weak Evolution Path.

Xu Ran being able to lead three Pet Beasts to successful evolution made him stand out in Beast Field 97, but in a Second Level Town, it was nothing noteworthy.

If he could establish contact with Second Level Town, it was not impossible for him to achieve it.

Therefore, to claim he had mastered a more powerful evolutionary form of the Velvet Sparrow was not very persuasive.

Seeing his daughter’s still defiant eyes, the Nightmare Beast King steeled himself.

"Screech~" ("Regarding the Evolution Path that human boy gave you, is there anything more specific?")

His daughter was searching for resources, which meant that the human had given her some information.

He wanted to discern the truth of this Evolution Path, thereby making his daughter give up completely.

This would be difficult for other wild Transcendent Beings, but not for the Nightmare Beast King.

Because once, it had attempted to break through to the Emperor Species.

Although it ultimately failed, during the process of challenging this entirely new Life Level, it still caught whispers of a voice.

This is the greatest Secret hidden behind the wild Transcendent Beings.

In every evolution process, they would capture strange whisperings filled with chaotic and enormous information, involving the ultimate secrets of life’s evolution.

Just by catching a glimpse of the Secret related to their own species, they would have the chance to soar to the skies.

There are no constraints or rules, but the thought of burying this Secret in their hearts and not letting other beings know it, is imprinted in their minds like a steel stamp from the first time they hear these chaotic whispers.

Such whisperings, however, do not occur in the evolution of Pet Beasts.

The Nightmare Beast King’s breakthrough failed, but its luck was extraordinarily good; the secret it caught was closely related to the essence of evolution.

This gave it a profound understanding of evolution.

As long as Twelve could mention more specific information, it could easily find contradictions and errors within the Evolution Path, thus proving this was nothing more than nonsense spouted by that human boy.

Seeing her father’s face still full of disbelief, Twelve’s stubbornness surged.

Since she had already allowed her father to speculate the true facts, she might as well let him know, the Beast Master she chose was extraordinary!

"Chirp!" ("This Evolution Path is…") Continue reading at NovelBin.Côm

Without much hesitation, Twelve blurted out the content of the Evolution Path for the Velvet Sparrow to evolve into a Sleeping Bird.

As Twelve finished speaking, an eerie silence fell over the scene.

For the first time, the Nightmare Beast King’s expression showed a noticeable change.

This Evolution Path seemed so ridiculous to it.

Improving all Skills of a Leader Species to Three Stars before evolution was like a delirious dream.

From what it understood amidst those mysterious whispers, only the Holy Spirit Race could raise Four Star skills to Five Stars.

And that was not merely an increase in stars; it was about integrating all Talent Skills into the Wheel of Life, which was fundamentally different.

Increasing the star rating of Skills is a characteristic of evolution; how could it be completed before evolution itself?

Yet, as the Nightmare Beast King was about to refute this Evolution Path and tell his daughter that there was definitely something wrong with it, it fell silent once more.

Because apart from that issue, there seemed to be no flaw whatsoever in this Evolution Path; it was so perfect that it astonished the king.

Whether it was the pairing of Evolution Materials or the setup of the Evolution Ritual, everything felt impeccably crafted.

-----------------"Screech?" ("So, the human Beast Master is claiming to have an Evolution Path for the Velvet Sparrow that is stronger than Demon Hawk?")

Although Twelve’s words were vague when she was forced to speak about the situation, the shrewd Nightmare Beast King instantly refined the most critical information from them.

The first thought that flew to his mind was how ludicrous and unbelievable it was.

As the de facto ruler of Beast Field 97, the Nightmare Beast King was not only active in its own domain, but had also visited other Beast King-level Beast Fields and even nearby Beast Emperor-level Beast Fields.

And its travels were indeed in search of the Velvet Sparrow’s Evolution Path.

To wild Transcendent Beings, especially those as intelligent as it, exchanging Evolution Paths possessed by their species with other domains was an effective way to improve their own.

If it encountered a Velvet Sparrow group that also evolved into Demon Hawks, it could compare the evolutionary differences between the two and optimize its own species’ Evolution Path.

If it came across a group of Velvet Sparrows with a different evolutionary form, it would be an even greater cause for celebration because this meant more evolutionary choices and possibilities for the species.

After traveling around neighboring domains and making various comparisons, the Nightmare Beast King concluded that for the time being, the Demon Hawk remained the strongest Evolutionary Form of the Velvet Sparrow species.

In such circumstances, when his daughter suddenly told him of a stronger Evolution Path, and the source was merely a human boy from a 3 Level town, how could he possibly believe it?

"Screech~" ("I see, you’ve been deceived by that human.")
