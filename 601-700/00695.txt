Chapter 700 - 337: Ziyun Takes Action, Dawn Star Radiance! _3

```

We’ve arrived,

With a "click," Xu Ran, standing on the outskirts of the valley, casually snapped off a piece of rock and examined it.

Unlike rocks from the outside world, this small piece had a faint glow flickering across its surface from time to time, along with some strange colored patterns, reminiscent of special ores and quite beautiful to look at.

Cancan raised a claw to touch the rock, and then its expression became a bit more surprised.

"Chah~" (This rock contains not only Earth attribute power but also other forces.)

"Xi Lu!" (It’s Star Power!)

Star whinnied.

Within the rock, it sensed a familiar force.

As a non-Earth attribute Pet Beast, this should not have been possible.

Everything was because the rock contained Star Power. It was this slight Star Power that made it feel a kinship.

"Xi Lu~" (Here, I can enhance the effect of my Prayer of Starry Night by more than thirty percent.)

After sensing the rich Star Power around it, Star’s voice became excited.

However many stars there may be in the sky, where can they compare to the Star Power in the ground that can be absorbed and utilized so easily?

"Elder Qi Yuan once said that the formation of Fallen Star Valley was related to celestial meteors," Xu Ran toyed with the rock in his hand and smiled, "It must be the Star Power within the meteors that were gradually absorbed by the surrounding rocks."

"Let’s go inside and take a look," Xu Ran gestured towards the deeper parts of Fallen Star Valley, his eyes shining brightly.

This is a good place indeed.

A man and his five Pet Beasts quickly crossed the rocky area on the outskirts of Fallen Star Valley and entered the valley.

Inside the valley, slopes descended on all sides, leading to the deepest part of the valley.

These slopes, weathered over a long period, were no longer smooth. They had undulating terrain and ancient ravines, but the overall direction remained unchanged, like a giant pot embedded in the earth, gathering the light of the stars.

Stepping inside, Xu Ran’s expression became more cautious.

For he had already felt a slightly malevolent gaze lurking in the dark.@@novelbin@@

Unlike outside the valley, this place was already inhabited by Transcendent Beings.

"Whoosh—"

A sharp whizzing sound ripped through the quiet night, swiftly attacking the man and his five beasts.

It was a feather that pierced straight into the rock in front of Xu Ran, pulverizing it instantly.

This was a threat as well as a warning.

But Xu Ran was unconcerned with such a threat.

He turned his head to look at Star beside him, "How many?"

Star’s eyes, which were like purple crystals, had inexplicably turned pitch black. Within them, black chains interwove and twined, rendering them particularly mysterious.

Three Star Skill, Halo Level - Night Inspection.

"Xi Lu~" (Over a hundred, the highest only at Leadership Stage.)

Star whinnied a response, accurately reporting the number and strength of nearby creatures.

"Only Leadership Stage?" Xu Ran raised an eyebrow, "Twelve."

"Jiu~" (Leave it to me!)

Twelve spoke eagerly, then flapped its wings and soared into the sky.

Its bright, ocean-blue eyes gazed downward, like two luminous sapphires against the dark night sky.

An invisible force radiated from it, sweeping the area in an instant.

Accompanied by soft thuds and the sound of falling bodies, all beings hidden in the dark immediately fell into a deep slumber.

Three Star Skill, Waning Moon Level - Endless Sleep!

A General stage Twelve could easily put a group of creatures at the highest Leadership Stage to sleep for hours. At this moment, this skill allowed the man and his five beasts to infiltrate deeper without raising any alarms.

"Nicely done," Xu Ran said, catching Twelve as it returned and complimenting it before they continued deeper.

Batch after batch of Transcendent Beings were put to sleep by Twelve, and Xu Ran along with the five little ones ventured ever deeper into Fallen Star Valley.

The Starlight, twinkling in the night around them, grew brighter and more brilliant, and the Star Power became increasingly concentrated.

The strength of Transcendent Beings had progressed from the Leadership Stage to the General Stage. At this level, Twelve could no longer put them to sleep for extended periods.

Sensing the intruders in the valley, a myriad of powerful presences rose to the sky, closing in swiftly on the man and his five beasts. Soon, they were surrounded from all sides, sealing off all possible escape routes.

An eerie silence fell over the scene, but beneath this quiet, there was a palpable undercurrent of killing intent.

The Transcendent Beings nesting here naturally bore no goodwill towards the Humans who had appeared.

"I have come to acquire a piece of Dawn Star Radiance," Xu Ran said calmly, smiling even amidst the encirclement of beasts, "Give it to me, and I’ll leave immediately."
