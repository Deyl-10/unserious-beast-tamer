Chapter 657 Chapter 326 Giving Xieyun City A Bit Of A Shock_2

Compared to the three pets that had joined the team earlier, Twelve's progress was a little more modest.

Having just broken through to the General Level not long ago, it hadn't had time to raise all its Skills to the Halo Level, but it already possessed two Halo Level Skills.

In addition to the four pets' diligent efforts, Firefly, who had not yet formed an official contract and joined this family, was also striving hard.

During the relentless training of the past ten days, it successfully raised the Proficiency of its Undying Flame to the Waning Moon Level.

It should be noted that this was achieved without any additional points allocated; reaching such Skill Proficiency was quite a feat for Firefly.

While working hard to become stronger, Xu Ran and the four pets never ceased their exploration of the areas outside the city.

Apart from the depths of Fallen Thunder Valley, which they had yet to penetrate so as not to alarm any potential threats, they had explored all other regions and their harvest was far from meager.

Now, as the emergence of Extinct Thunder Attraction drew ever closer, and the unusual phenomena of Thunderbolts became increasingly distinct, the entire atmosphere of Fallen Thunder Valley grew progressively tense.

At such a critical time, the man and his four pets had other plans in mind.

Because Xu Ran was just one step away from the Fifth Stage contract power.

Once Xu Ran broke through, Cancan, who could evolve after ascending to the King Stage, would be the first to make the breakthrough. With the strength of the Beast King Level, it would add considerable weight to the contest for the Extinct Thunder Attraction.

But before that, they needed to visit Xieyun City, to blaze through the Beast Trainer Ranking at the General Level, and claim all the rewards due to them.

Otherwise, the loss would be more than just trifling.

"Tweet~" (Are we going to challenge the Beast Trainer Ranking?)

Twelve issued an expectant cry, its eyes filled with eager anticipation.

Previously, when the three younger pets took on the Beast Trainer Ranking at the Leadership Stage in Xieyun City, it hadn't formed a contract with Xu Ran and thus couldn't accompany him to Xieyun City.

After hearing the three pets vividly recount their honors and gains from the Beast Trainer Ranking, Twelve's envy was undeniable.

Now, it finally had its chance to participate.

-----------------

Xieyun City, the Beast Master Association, the Beast Trainer Ranking.

Every day, Beast Masters come to this majestic and towering structure.

They either admire the powerful Beast Masters listed, listening to others narrate their glorious exploits, or they attempt to climb the ranking themselves to gauge the gap between them and those on the list, each with different goals in mind.@@novelbin@@

On this particular day, a group of new faces appeared in front of the Beast Trainer Ranking.

Looking up at the lofty jade-like lists, their faces bore expressions of eager anticipation.

"Is this the Beast Trainer Ranking of Xieyun City?" asked one of the Beast Masters with a flamboyant hairstyle, chuckling, "I've heard this place bears the footsteps of the strongest Beast Masters throughout Xieyun City's history. I wonder, how many can Yun Tianao surpass?"

"Young man, you sure are confident. Surpassing how many?" A middle-aged uncle beside him couldn't help but speak out upon hearing this, "Are you from out of town?"

"Tianao, be quiet." The leading Beast Master patted the man known as Yun Tianao, then greeted the middle-aged uncle with a slight bow, "Uncle has good insight, we come from Zhou Tian City."

"May I ask where is the ranking list for General Level Beast Masters?"

"The General Stage?" The middle-aged uncle's expression changed slightly upon hearing this, as the man before him appeared very young, seemingly not even thirty years old.

At such an age, to have reached the General Level, one must surely be extraordinary.

"Over there." The middle-aged uncle pointed to the area where the General Level Beast Trainer Ranking was located, then turned and left.

"Hey, uncle, don't go." Yun Tianao shouted, seemingly still wanting to drag the middle-aged uncle along, but he was stopped by the lead man.

"Let's go take a look," the leading man said, shaking his head slightly, then led his group in the direction indicated by the uncle.

"Tianao, we must be more careful here in Xieyun City," the leader advised as they walked.

"What's there to be careful about?" Yun Tianao replied dismissively, "We've come for the exchange battle precisely to show them what we've got."

"Otherwise, these Beast Masters from Xieyun City might think they're the best in the world!" Yun Tianao snorted, "We acknowledge President Fang Canghai's strength."

"But our Zhou Tian City is the 47th Beast Field's most dangerous Second Level Town. With a minor beast tide every three days and a major one every five days, any Beast Master that survives is someone who has fought their way out of a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood. There are none that aren't strong."

"In comparison, Xieyun City's younger generation is like flowers grown in a greenhouse; what do they have to compare with us?"

Hearing this, the others from Zhou Tian City also showed approving expressions; it was clear that at heart, they didn't hold much regard for the Beast Masters of Xieyun City.

"Don't underestimate the Beast Masters from other cities," the leader warned them but seeing that his companions were unconvinced, he shook his head and gave up the lesson.

He halted his steps, looking at the towering Beast Trainer Ranking in front of him, he spoke slowly, "You already know the rules for challenging the ranking from our journey here."

"With that said, let's give it a shot."

"Heh heh, that's what I've been waiting to hear," Yun Tianao chuckled, and then rushed without hesitation towards the list he had already identified.

The others dispersed like birds and beasts, each dashing towards different lists.

Before long, the "clang" of bells cascaded one after another, echoing throughout the Beast Trainer Ranking area. One after another, the lists lit up, clearly indicating a widespread attempt at climbing the rankings.
