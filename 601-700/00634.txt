Chapter 634 - 320: The Brand New Form Of Twelve!_3

The Blood Essence, once unconcerned and quiet, seemed as if it were suddenly awakened at this moment, bursting forth with a terror so potent that one could even catch a glimpse of a massive Demon Hawk flashing in the blood light.

However, the target of this explosive momentum that shot towards the heavens was not Twelve.

With extreme ferocity and no regard for reason, it directly suppressed all clash of energy from the Evolution Resources.

Like a father pressing down the head of a villain harming his daughter, drowning him forcefully in water, that dominant power melded all the other forces into the Blood Essence.@@novelbin@@

Evolution, the most arduous process, undoubtedly lies in gradually absorbing the diverse Evolution Materials, eventually unifying their power, transforming it into one’s own.

Yet now, this power hidden within the Blood Essence, was doing something similar.

It ground and merged the forces infused into the Blood Essence, piece by piece, ultimately integrating a small portion that had completed fusion, along with some Blood Essence, into Twelve’s body.

Bit by bit. After a deep breath, Twelve’s gaze finally settled on the various resources placed at the side of the raised platform.

Each of these resources pulsated with tremendous energy, each one worth all the combined power within its body.

And now, it intended to consume these resources in one go, absorbing their energy entirely as the driving force for its own evolution.

There was no doubt that this process was perilous; an understanding that at the slightest mishap, it might be blasted apart by the overwhelming power and perish on the spot.

But, this is what all evolution must go through.

Without hesitation, Twelve swallowed all the resources in one gulp.

In the end, it drained the drop of Blood Essence from its own father to the last.

The Blood Essence, brimming with the breath of life and power, became the solvent to everything; it melded all the resources together and caused the conflicts between different energies to reach their most intense in a flash.

Torturous pain was written all over Twelve’s sea-blue eyes in an instant.

At this moment, it felt as if multiple forces were battling within its body, fighting individually without any concern for its life or death.

These forces ruthlessly tore at Twelve’s inner body, causing its breath to weaken considerably in a very short period.

However, as it’s breath weakened, the energy fluctuations around Twelve surged unnaturally rapidly, signifying the beginning of an out-of-control evolution.

"So soon?" Xu Ran was startled, his expression turning tense quickly.

Although there were moments of life-and-death crisis when the three little ones evolved into King Species, it all happened after the evolution reached a certain stage.

Had Twelve just swallowed the resources and was already in such danger?

"This should, relate to my blood," the Nightmare Beast King beside him seemed to realize something, speaking in a lower tone, "Evolution requires Superpower-tier King Level Blood Essence, but I am not just any King Stage."

"My blood, is stronger."

"However, there is no need to worry too much," the Nightmare Beast King watched closely Twelve’s abnormal condition, and spoke slowly, "The Blood Essence you humans obtain is often from those whose owners have long perished, but I am still alive, right here."

"This is my blood, how could I let it harm my own daughter?" In the eyes of the Nightmare Beast King, pride glimmered, "Watch, even if Twelve evolves into a Sleeping bird, it will certainly not be an ordinary one."

As if in response to the Nightmare Beast King’s words, the power that had been chaotically backlashing inside Twelve seemed to have been paused, settling down suddenly.

Yet, to Twelve itself, the situation was entirely different.

The violent, disordered energies within its body clashed fiercely, rending its flesh from inside, but when the carrying Blood Essence came into contact with Twelve’s wounds, with its own blood, everything changed.

The Blood Essence, once unconcerned and quiet, seemed as if it were suddenly awakened at this moment, bursting forth with a terror so potent that one could even catch a glimpse of a massive Demon Hawk flashing in the blood light.
