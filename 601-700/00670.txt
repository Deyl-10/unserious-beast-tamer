Chapter 675 - 331 Difficult Victory, Ziyun Evolves!_2

```

The long knife Ziyun had transformed into, that razor-sharp blade, also developed numerous large and small notches from the repeated strikes.

However, the notches healed at a speed that was even faster than the rate at which Xu Ran and Star recovered from their injuries.

Four Stars Skill, Violent Sun Level—Immortal Body!

This skill not only allowed Ziyun to easily change shape, but it also possessed a tremendous healing ability!

On the other side, things didn’t look too good for the Phantom Thunder Gryphon.

Despite its best efforts to avoid injury, its body still bore four or five large and small blade wounds after several clashes.

Each wound became the straw that broke the camel’s back at this moment.

The killing intent in the eyes of the Phantom Thunder Gryphon grew more intense; it understood that it could delay no further and lunged forward even before Xu Ran could make a move.

But the next moment, along with an enraged roar, the imposing pressure that suddenly descended halted its forward motion.

In the void, streams of Dragon Turtle Light Patterns rapidly flashed, instantly enveloping the entire Fallen Thunder Valley.

Along with the trembling mountains, Cancan, who had been lying on the ground, stood back up, its fierce gold-colored eyes staring dead at the Phantom Thunder Gryphon.

"Chia!" (That hurts a lot!)

With a roar, its enormous claw, akin to a small mountain, crashed down towards the Phantom Thunder Gryphon.

A flash of surprise crossed the eyes of the Phantom Thunder Gryphon once more.

Recovering so quickly?

It hadn’t been like this just a moment ago, had it?

Though surprised, its reactions were far from slow; it erupted with powerful energy and, transforming into an afterimage, swiftly dodged from under Cancan’s crushing claw, widening the gap between them.

Gazing at the minuscule figure before it, discontent filled Cancan’s eyes.

Recover quickly?

That’s because this time it wielded the Heaven-Earth Law, and its target wasn’t the recovery!

Sensing the Phantom Thunder Gryphon’s power as much stronger than that of the Mysterious Azure Thunder Dragon, Cancan naturally didn’t dare reduce its recovery, turning itself into a live target with only one shot at retaliation.

Therefore, it had to reduce its defense.

That was the reason it ended up in such a sorry state after being hit by the Phantom Thunder Gryphon.

In the void, the pace of the Dragon Turtle Light Patterns accelerated suddenly, causing the entire Fallen Thunder Valley to shake violently under the tremendous and invisible pressure.

The Phantom Thunder Gryphon’s wing-flapping stuttered slightly, its movements momentarily hindered.

In the next instant, Cancan’s raised giant claw was already smashing towards it.

Atop that massive claw, an immense earthy-yellow energy transformed into an incredibly deep vortex, as if possessing a formidable strength capable of swallowing everything.

Land of Destruction reborn!

With its recovery intact, Cancan now had the confidence to execute this most powerful move in succession. Its reappearance altered the expression of the Phantom Thunder Gryphon.

Again?

This powerful skill, could it be as common as cabbages?

It cursed inwardly, hurriedly dispersing the oppressive force around it, and flapped its wings to dodge.

However, Cancan, which had already been evaded by the Phantom Thunder Gryphon twice, would not make the same mistake again.

"Chia!" (Star God Blessing!)

Accompanied by a roar, dazzling Starlight appeared around Cancan in an instant. These starlights intertwined in the void, forming countless constellations that enshrouded its massive body.

Meanwhile, Cancan’s momentum rose sharply, while on the other side, Xu Ran and Star’s combined strength suddenly plummeted.

To support Cancan in its strongest state, even the combined force of Xu Ran and Star was stretched thin.

Cancan only had one chance to strike.

But when it comes to opportunity, once can be enough.@@novelbin@@

In the void, the Dragon Turtle Light Patterns burst forth with blinding light.

Like mystical runes, they wove together into unfathomable might, and the ascending pressure rendered the Phantom Thunder Gryphon, which had just broken free, completely immobile.

In the next moment, upon Cancan’s claw, the fully charged Land of Destruction smashed into the body of the Phantom Thunder Gryphon.

The void suddenly collapsed at that moment, shattering into dust, and when all settled, all that remained was a single feather interwoven with purple and white patterns.

That feather was the last evidence that the Phantom Thunder Gryphon had ever existed in this world.

Cancan grabbed its trophy and swiftly shrank, jubilantly returning to Xu Ran and its other companions.

"Chia!" (I am so strong!)

Clutching the feather, Cancan, as if it had transformed from a destructive beast to a somewhat goofy child, couldn’t help but show a silly smile on its face.

It had defeated the mightiest Beast King!

"Well done, but you can’t forget Star’s contributions," Xu Ran tapped lightly on Cancan’s head and then looked up at the sky.

With the settling dust, the Thunder cloud attracted by the Extinct Thunder Attraction began to disperse.

"Star, help Ziyun recover."

"Xi Lu~" (Okay.)

Star neighed, swiftly connecting Star Oath to Ziyun, aiding it to quickly recover the energy it had expended earlier.

Once Ziyun was back at its peak, Xu Ran tossed the Extinct Thunder Attraction towards Ziyun, "No time to waste, get ready for evolution."

The Evolution Ritual for Ziyun required its completion atop the skies, at the peak of the thunder clouds, and the current environment was just suitable.

"Cancan, get bigger."

"Chia?" (I need to grow more?)

Cancan, which had just decreased in size, was momentarily dumbfounded.

"The bigger, the better, and don’t weaken your defense," Xu Ran’s words paused slightly, "Use your height to send Ziyun above the thunder clouds."
