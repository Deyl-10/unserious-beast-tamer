Chapter 640 - 322: The Trail Of The Sparrow Behind The Scenes

[No content, to be supplemented tomorrow]

This was their first action target with their little friends since contracting with Xu Ran.

It had to exert a part of its power!

In this regard, Number Twelve had an advantage the other three did not possess.

It came from the Beast Field, from a group of wild Transcendent Beings.

It understood the group of wild Transcendent Beings better than Xu Ran and the other three.

After pondering for a moment, Number Twelve suddenly spoke up.

"Chirp~" (If I’m not mistaken, the powerful creatures that have discovered the Extinct Thunder Attraction should not be limited to the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow.)

"Meow?" (Are there others?)

Ziyun was startled and couldn’t help asking, her expression becoming much more grave.

According to the information they had gathered before, the Thunder Attribute Beast Kings guarding the Extinct Thunder Attraction were only the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow and the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King, the latter of which they had already ambushed and successfully killed.

Logically, only the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow could be a threat to them.

Hearing Ziyun’s puzzlement, Number Twelve shook its head slightly.

"Chirp~" (In the wild, if Transcendent Beings find a resource that is useful to them but cannot be obtained immediately, guarding it is just one option.)

"Chirp~" (In addition, there are some who, after ensuring the safety of the resource, will leave their marks and means of surveillance, and then wait for easy prey.)

(Generally speaking, the latter is more dangerous than the former.)

(Because the former is also their hunting target.)

"Xi Lu~" (Could it really be so?)

Star let out a neigh, and its expression became grave upon hearing Number Twelve’s words.

If what Number Twelve said was true, then the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow and the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King might only be the forces in plain sight, with possibly one or even several more powerful Transcendent Beings lurking in the dark, also eyeing the Extinct Thunder Attraction?

"Meow~" (Then, is there a way to discover them?)

Ziyun grew impatient.

The unknown was the most terrifying thing.

Not knowing how many Beast Kings they would have to fight for the resource in the future was causing her significant anxiety.

Fortunately, Number Twelve quickly gave an affirmative answer.

"Chirp~" (There’s a way.)

As the daughter of the Nightmare Beast King, and having spent a long time with the Beast King, Number Twelve was extremely sensitive to the aura of the Beast King level.

With just one visit to the Fallen Thunder Valley, it was confident it could confirm whether a powerful Beast King was coveting the Extinct Thunder Attraction and had left a mark.@@novelbin@@

"Cha!" (No time to lose, let’s go tonight!)

Cancan shouted excitedly, her eyes brimming with excitement.

Cancan, the Adventurer, was setting out on a new adventure!

"Meow~" (Let’s inform Xu Ran about this first.)

Ziyun took a deep breath and reached out to the busy Xu Ran through Contractual Sensing.

In the Washing and Protection room, Xu Ran paused for a moment as he was caring for a Pet Beast.

What does that mean?

According to Number Twelve’s speculation on the wild Transcendent Beings, the Beast Kings eyeing the Extinct Thunder Attraction could be more than just the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow?

Suddenly, he felt a headache coming on.

This could be troublesome.

Fortunately, Number Twelve also said it wasn’t certain.

Whether it was true or not needed to be investigated in person.

"Boss Xu? Is there something wrong with my Pet Beast?" asked the customer who had been closely watching Xu Ran’s actions when he stopped, unable to contain his curiosity.

Even the Pet Beast, which was previously full of joy, now cast a reproachful glance at him.

You’re supposed to keep going!

"Ah, sorry," Xu Ran quickly apologized and refocused his attention on the current cleaning and caring, while responding to the quartet through Contractual Sensing.

"We’ll take action tonight." This was their first action target with their little friends since contracting with Xu Ran.
