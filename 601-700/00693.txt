"We’ve arrived."

Under the night sky, Xu Ran, with his four little ones, rode the Star at lightning speed and soon reached the destination.

Before them lay a valley with a somewhat strange shape.

Unlike common valleys, the valley’s edge had layered and complex terrain formed by overlapping rocks, but the interior was a large depression, like the bottom of a pot.

Under the cover of darkness, the rocks in the valley shimmered faintly, as if containing the power of the stars, and this light grew more intense the closer it was to the center of the valley.

This was their destination, Fallen Star Valley.

"Crack~" Standing at the edge of the valley, Xu Ran casually broke off a piece of rock and examined it.

Unlike ordinary rocks, this small piece occasionally twinkled and had strange, colorful patterns, like a special ore, looking extremely pretty.

Cancan lifted a paw to touch the rock, then its expression turned more surprised.

"Chah~" (This rock contains not only Earth attribute power but also other powers.)

"Xi Lu!" (It’s Star Power!)

The Star whinnied, sensing a trace of familiar power within the rock.

As a Pet Beast with no Earth attribute, such a situation should not exist.

All because the rock contained Star Power; it was this faint Star Power that made it feel an affinity.

"Xi Lu~" (Here, the effects of my "Prayer of Starry Night" can be enhanced by more than thirty percent.)

After feeling the rich Star Power around, Star’s voice grew excited.

No matter how numerous the stars above, where could be easier than the Star Power on the ground to absorb and utilize?

"Elder Qi Yuan mentioned the formation of Fallen Star Valley was related to the meteorites from outer space," said Xu Ran, toying with the rock in his hand, smiling, "It seems the Star Power from the meteorites has gradually been absorbed by the surrounding rocks."

"Let’s go inside and have a look." Xu Ran looked towards the deeper parts of Fallen Star Valley, his eyes gleaming brightly.

What a great place this was.

One man with his five Pet Beasts rapidly crossed the rocky terrain on the periphery of Fallen Star Valley and entered the valley.

The valley was surrounded by slopes on all sides, leading to the deepest point of the valley.

Over a long period of erosion, the slopes were no longer smooth, with undulations and ancient gullies, but the overall trend had not changed. It was like a giant pot set into the earth, gathering the light of the stars.

Upon entering, Xu Ran’s expression grew more cautious.

For he had already felt an unfriendly gaze lurking in the dark.

Unlike the valley exterior, Transcendent Beings had settled here.

"Swoosh——"

A sharp sound of cutting through the air shattered the nights silence and swiftly attacked the man and his five beasts.

It was a feather, which stabbed directly into a rock in front of Xu Ran, turning it to dust in an instant.

This was a threat, as well as a warning.

But faced with such a threat, Xu Ran didn’t care.

He turned his head to look at Star, "How many?"

The eyes of Star, once like purple crystals, had turned pitch black, and within them, black chains intertwined and wound around, looking extremely mysterious.

Three Star Skill, Halo Level: Night Inspection.

"Xi Lu~" (Hundreds, with the highest at the Leadership Stage.)

The Star whinnied, accurately reporting the number and strength of nearby beings.

"Just at the Leadership Stage?" Xu Ran raised an eyebrow, "Twelve."@@novelbin@@

"Jiu~" (Leave it to me!)

Twelve spoke excitedly, then spread its wings and soared into the sky.

Its bright sea-blue eyes gazed down below, like two glowing sapphires against the dark curtain of the night.

An invisible force emanated from its center, sweeping the area in an instant.

Amidst faint sounds of bodies hitting the ground and falling, all creatures hidden in the darkness instantly entered the realm of slumber.

Three Star Skill, Waning Moon Level: Endless Sleep!

For Twelve at the General Stage, using this skill on a group of creatures at most the Leadership Stage was enough to put them to sleep for several hours. At this moment, the skill allowed the man and his five beasts to penetrate deeper into the valley without alerting anyone.

"Well done." Catching Twelve as it returned, Xu Ran praised satisfactorily, and then proceeded further.

Group after group of Transcendent Beings were subjected to forced sleep by Twelve, and Xu Ran along with his five little ones ventured deeper into Fallen Star Valley.

The Starlight twinkling in the night around them grew ever more brilliant, and the Star Power became increasingly rich. Read exclusive adventures at empire

The strength of the Transcendent Beings had risen from the Leadership Stage to the General Stage. At this level, Twelve could no longer put them to sleep for an extended time.

Sensing the intruders in the valley, powerful auras erupted, speeding towards the man and his five beasts, and soon appeared around them, entirely blocking all their retreat paths.

An eerie silence fell over the scene, yet beneath this quiet there was a current of strong killing intent.

To the Transcendent Beings who inhabited this place, there would be no goodwill towards the humans that appeared here.

"I’ve come for a ’Dawn Star Radiance.’" Even surrounded by the creatures, Xu Ran remained calm and spoke with a smile, "Give it to me, and I’ll leave immediately."
