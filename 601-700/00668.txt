Chapter 673 - 330: Thunder Dragon Vs Cancan, The True Mastermind Behind The Scenes_4

```

"Although I don’t know who you are, I do know that the guy lurking behind isn’t just the Profound Thunder Dragon," Xu Ran said slowly, facing the giant beast. "So, do you feel like introducing yourself?"

"Stalling for time is futile," the giant beast glanced at Cancan, whose power had not fully recovered yet, "I am called Phantom Thunder Gryphon."

"Phantom Thunder Gryphon... It seems that there are still quite a few powerful creatures hidden within Beast Field No. 47..." Xu Ran shook his head helplessly. Your next journey awaits at empire

He had never heard of this species before.

But, he could feel the strength of the creature before him.

It was a strength that did not fall short of the Nightmare Beast King, perhaps even surpassing it.

Without a doubt, this creature, just like the Nightmare Beast King, had attempted to evolve into an Emperor Species but had failed, ending up with power beyond that of an ordinary Beast King, yet unable to break free from the shackles of its Growth Stage.

And the reason for its failure was probably related to its Dual Attribute.

Transcendent Beings with multiple attributes face a much greater difficulty in evolving. Completing one evolution to reach the King Species is already an exceptional existence, to accomplish it twice is nearly impossible.

Xu Ran’s expression gradually became more solemn.

He had been suspecting that within Fallen Thunder Valley, there was some interference from a Super ability Attribute power.

[Only 1,800 more to go, typing furiously]

The Phantom Thunder Gryphon before him matched all his speculations about the hidden mastermind.

Undoubtedly, it was the true fisherman lying in wait.

Four Stars skill, Violent Sun Level·Land of Destruction!

Profound Thunder Dragon, perish!

After delivering this final blow, Cancan’s enormous body rapidly shrank, returning to its original kilometer size.

On its face was a trace of fatigue and a sense of incompleteness.

In the fighting just now, it had for the first time fully demonstrated the power of Heaven-Earth Law, and unlike the previous Jiezimixu, Cancan could choose to strengthen one attribute while weakening another.

What it had chosen was to weaken its own Recovery.

That was also the reason it could keep up with the speed of the Profound Thunder Dragon during the recent fight.

But the weakening of its Recovery also made Cancan’s normally sustainable combat endurance plummet to a level even below that of Ziyun’s.

Just one burst of output had left it feeling a fatigue it hadn’t experienced in a long time.

Fortunately, such a cost was worth it.

The full force of Heaven-Earth Law combined with Echoing of Earth Vein had instantly boosted Cancan’s strength to a terrifying level close to that of the Overlord Stage. Paired with the Violent Sun Level Four Stars skill Land of Destruction, it had instantly killed the Profound Thunder Dragon.

You should know, this was a Beast King of the Great Complement.

The last one to achieve such a swift kill was the Nightmare Beast King.

This meant that Cancan’s strength was now every bit as strong as the other’s.@@novelbin@@

The fight was over, and instinctively, a golden glow began to surge around Cancan’s body, as it, with its Recovery power restored to its original state, sought to replenish the energy it had expended.

But the next moment, Xu Ran’s voice appeared in Cancan’s mind.

"Don’t use Echoing of Earth Vein, slow down."

"Huh?" (Is there another situation?)

Cancan’s golden eyes flickered, instantly understanding Xu Ran’s meaning, and the golden glow slowly dissipated.

It lay on the ground, drawing in the Earth Attribute Power from its surroundings at a rate slightly slower than normal to slowly fill its significant energy deficit.

At this rate, it would take no less than ten minutes to return to peak condition.

But Cancan was not in the slightest bit concerned.

Because it could feel the faint traces of Starlight flickering around, ready to connect itself with the stars at any moment.

```

Cancan completed her disguise convincingly, and couldn’t help but feel a surge of curiosity.

Looking like this, Xu Ran is about to trick someone again.

But… who else is there to trick?

She couldn’t help but look towards the Dragon Scale not far away, left behind after the demise of the Mysterious Azure Thunder Dragon, which was a resource produced by the King Stage of the Mysterious Azure Thunder Dragon.

Having produced resources, the Mysterious Azure Thunder Dragon had undoubtedly died.

Could there be other hidden forces behind the scenes?

Excitement flashed through Cancan’s eyes and then disappeared.

How thrilling! She loved it!

"The Extinct Thunder Attraction now belongs to us!" Xu Ran laughed heartily, approaching the Extinct Thunder Attraction that had fallen to the ground again with the other three little ones, and then made the motion of picking it up.

At the moment he bent over, a sharp glint flashed in the depths of Xu Ran’s eyes.

The next instant, his body, holding the Extinct Thunder Attraction, abruptly flew back several steps.

A Thunderbolt fell silently in the original position of the Extinct Thunder Attraction, instantly eroding the surrounding earth and forming a small-scale plasma field.

If Xu Ran had still been there, he would likely have been converted into plasma as well.

Seeing this, Xu Ran couldn’t help but wipe the cold sweat from his forehead, then turned his gaze towards a certain place in the void.

"Cunning Humans."

A dull voice echoed throughout Fallen Thunder Valley.

At the same time, as Xu Ran’s gaze solidified, the space he was looking at slowly twisted, and a figure emerged in the void. It seemed to have just arrived, yet also seemed as if it had been there for a long time.

It was a Giant Beast with a lion’s head but a body like that of an eagle. Its wingspan was a massive forty meters, and every single feather was shooting out strong, unparalleled Thunderbolt light. The third eye on its forehead seemed to have the power to captivate the soul.

"It takes one to know one." Upon seeing the other party clearly, Xu Ran breathed out softly, his face not showing much surprise, "You’ve finally come out."

The real creature eyeing the Extinct Thunder Attraction had finally made its appearance.

Ziyun and Twelve both inhaled sharply at this moment.

Because the two of them felt a familiar power emanating from this creature before them.

This Beast King turned out to be an extremely rare Dual-attribute Beast King, possessing both Thunder Attribute and Super ability Attribute.

"You know me?"

The mysterious Giant Beast’s eyes flickered with a human-like surprise.

"No, I don’t." Xu Ran shook his head slightly.

In this instant, he cross-referenced all the creatures mentioned on the adventure map and couldn’t find any that matched the one before him.

"Although I don’t know you, I do know that those who hide behind the scenes are not limited to the Mysterious Azure Thunder Dragon." Looking at the Giant Beast before him, Xu Ran spoke slowly, "So, how about introducing yourself?"

"Stalling for time is useless." The Giant Beast glanced at Cancan, whose Power had not fully recovered, "My name is Phantom Thunder Gryphon."

"Phantom Thunder Gryphon... It seems that there are still many powerful creatures hidden within the 47th Beast Field..." Xu Ran shook his head helplessly.

He had never heard of this species.

But he could feel the strength of the creature before him.

It was a Power that was no less than that of the Nightmare Beast King, and perhaps even greater.

Without a doubt, this creature, just like the Nightmare Beast King, had attempted to evolve into the Emperor Species but had failed to do so, gaining formidable Power that went beyond the average Beast King but unable to break free from the shackles of the Growth stage.

And its failure was most likely related to its Dual attribute.

Transcendent Beings with multiple Attributes already faced greater Evolution Difficulty; managing one evolution to become a King Species was already an extraordinary existence, trying to accomplish a second evolution was almost a fantasy.

Xu Ran’s expression gradually became solemn.

He had been suspecting that within Fallen Thunder Valley, there was some kind of Super ability Attribute power interference
