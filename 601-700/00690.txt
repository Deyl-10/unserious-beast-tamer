Chapter 695 - 336 Clues To The Star Evolution Materials!_2

```

"They are much more powerful than the average King Stage," he said, "comparable to your pet beast that has already evolved into the Emperor Species."

"Defeating them is not an easy task," Qi Yuan said with a smile.

"Fallen Star Mountain Range..." Xu Ran etched the place name firmly in his mind, "Thank you for the clue, senior."

"It’s nothing." Qi Yuan smiled again, "Is there anything else I can help you with?"

"There is one more thing." Xu Ran smiled awkwardly, "I have a friend who runs a foster shop in Xuanxing City..."

He recounted in detail how Du Long had wreaked havoc at the Wind and Cloud Foster Care Shop without being punished by the Beast Master Association.

After listening, Qi Yuan’s expression turned sour.

"Du Long..." he muttered the name under his breath, "It sounds a bit familiar."

A moment later, a figure appeared in his mind.

"I am aware of this matter." Qi Yuan hummed lowly, "Rest assured, there will soon be a fair resolution to this incident."

"You have my gratitude, senior," Xu Ran said, relieved.

He had also managed to help Boss Liu out with his issue.

Xuanxing City, Wind and Cloud Foster Care Shop.

Having just finished the washing and protection work for a prestigious customer, Liu Fengyun tidied up the cleaning room and walked out at a leisurely pace.

One of the staff members in the foster shop suddenly walked over quickly. Read latest stories on empire

"Boss! I have good news!"

"What good news?" Liu Fengyun glanced at the staff member, raising his eyebrows.

The person before him had a unique job at the Wind and Cloud Foster: he was specifically responsible for collecting information about rival shops in Xuanxing City, allowing Liu Fengyun to be well-informed about other businesses.

The marketplace is a battlefield.

Simply minding his own business was not Liu Fengyun’s style.

"Some customers of Pingtian Foster Shop were poached," the employee said with a smirk, "After the poaching, the Pingtian Foster Shop brought in a few thugs to make trouble at the other shop’s location."

"We can join forces with the victim to expose the actions of Pingtian Foster Shop, which will certainly damage their reputation."

"That’s a good idea." Liu Fengyun nodded slightly, "Tan Shao is still up to his old tricks, as usual."

"What’s the name of the shop that poached from Pingtian Foster Shop?" Liu Fengyun asked casually, "It must be no small feat to outdo Pingtian, right?"

"I haven’t been able to find out much about that shop," the employee scratched his head, "All I know is that it’s a new shop, and the name is Starfire..."

"Starfire Foster Care Shop?!" Liu Fengyun’s head shot up instantly.

"Yes," the employee said, surprised, "Boss, do you know about it?"

"Haha, so it’s Boss Xu." Liu Fengyun chuckled, "If it’s him, it makes sense that he would poach from Pingtian."

"Let’s not bother with this," Liu Fengyun dismissed with a wave of his hand, "Tan Shao is definitely no match for Boss Xu."

"Boss, you mean the owner of that Starfire Foster Store is very formidable?" the employee asked incredulously.

Previously, he hadn’t paid much attention to the victim of the incident.

Unexpectedly, the boss seemed to hold the store called Starfire Foster in high regard.

"After a while, you’ll see," Liu Fengyun said with a smile, "Go on with your work."

"...Alright." The employee spoke resignedly and then turned to leave.

Watching the employee’s departing figure, Liu Fengyun’s face bore a smile, "Setting up the shop in just one night, Boss Xu really acts with thunderous speed and windy efficiency."

"As an old friend, I ought to congratulate him on the new store’s opening."

Saying so, he stepped out of his own shop and headed towards the direction of the Starfire Foster Store.@@novelbin@@

After expressing his gratitude to Qi Yuan several times, Xu Ran returned to his shop with his five small pets.

On the way back, Star’s movements were noticeably larger than before, showing a sprightly enthusiasm.

It was clear that having some leads on both resources had excited it.

"After we close for the night, let’s head to Fallen Star Valley," Xu Ran said, patting Star’s head with a smile.

"Meow~" (Those two at the Quasi-domineering Level, I’ll take care of them!)

Ziyun licked its paw, eyes ablaze with a fighting spirit.

Although that guy named Qi Yuan had said those at the Quasi-domineering Level were a match for it, Ziyun felt Qi Yuan had no idea of its true strength.

Mere creatures not yet at the Overlord Stage~

"Xi Lu~" (Thank you, Ziyun!)

Star neighed, quickening its pace even more.

If nothing unexpected happened, the Dawn Star Radiance would soon be within reach, and then all that would be left to find was the Town Star Stone.

With the experience of Ziyun seeking the Extinct Thunder Attraction earlier, Star was already mentally prepared to spend more time and effort finding this most important evolution resource for itself.

Soon, one man and five pets arrived back at the shop.

Seeing the figure standing outside his shop door, surprise flashed across Xu Ran’s face.

"Boss Liu? Why are you here?"

[After working overtime for five days, I need to adjust my state. I owe four thousand words, which I will make up for tomorrow.]

"The kindness of the swordsmanship you bestowed upon me, I can never repay," Xu Ran said, tucking the swordsmanship carefully into his chest as he expressed his gratitude once again."

"It’s a minor matter," Qi Yuan said with a calm smile, "If you really feel obligated, you can come and spar with me some more."

"Definitely!" Xu Ran agreed without hesitation.

Just one sparring session with Qi Yuan had given him numerous insights into the ways of the sword, and now with the new swordsmanship, future sparring could serve to verify his techniques.
