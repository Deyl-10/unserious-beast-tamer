Chapter 626 - 318: Return To Qingzhou, Meet The Beast King! _3

Fierce thunderbolts streaking across occasionally gave Fallen Thunder Valley under the moonlight an extra dose of madness and desolation, causing a tremor in Ziyun’s heart.

It sensed a vague familiarity within that thunder and lightning.

Moreover, as the intensity approached closer and closer, that feeling of familiarity grew stronger and stronger.

Soon, Xu Ran and the three little ones stopped at the foot of the mountain outside Fallen Thunder Valley.

Here, they could already clearly feel the power of the thunder within Fallen Thunder Valley.

This was their first time being so close to Fallen Thunder Valley. Xu Ran dismounted, turned his head to look at Ziyun, "How do you feel?"

"Meow~" (I want it!)

Ziyun’s heterochromatic eyes sparkled with anticipation.

"I meant do you sense when the Extinct Thunder Attraction will emerge," Xu Ran said helplessly as he touched his forehead.

Hearing this, Ziyun’s eyes carried a hint of embarrassment.

It quickly began to sense seriously, and after a moment, shook its head.

"Meow~" (It’s a bit far, we need to get closer.)

"Get closer..." Xu Ran stroked his chin, "Then let’s climb up."

Having said that, he took the lead, began to climb toward the mountain peak outside the valley.

Almost at the same time, the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow inside the valley turned its head towards the direction Xu Ran was in.

Through its unique root perception, the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow sensed that the newcomers were a human and three General Stage Pet Beasts.

This configuration could only belong to a Beast Master.

Another fool who knows no better.

The Thunder Patterned Gold Willow would not show mercy to any being entering Fallen Thunder Valley.

It could not allow a slightest leak about the emergence of the Extinct Thunder Attraction, especially now when its emergence was imminent.

The Thunder Patterned Gold Willow momentarily cut off its roots’ transfer of energy to the Extinct Thunder Attraction, and its willowy, ribbon-like branches began to gently sway. The striking thunder patterns on them flickered brightly and dimly, as if some terrifying power was brewing within them.

It was ready for action—once the other party climbed from outside the valley to the mountain peak and saw the situation inside the valley, it would strike immediately, annihilating them in an instant.

In the midst of preparing, a thought abruptly crossed the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow’s mind as its peripheral vision caught an empty column aside—could it be that this human Beast Master was the one who killed the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King?

The next moment, the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow laughed at its own thought.

How could that be possible!

A mere General Level Beast Master killing the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King was simply unthinkable.

To the Gold Willow, it seemed far more plausible that the Thunder Ray Mysterious Bat King had been killed by another powerful Beast King or a King Level Beast Master. That would make sense.

Sensing that the human was getting closer to the mountain peak, the Thunder Patterned Gold Willow calmed the emotions swirling in its core. The intimidating power brewing on its swaying branches grew more and more frightening.

"Meow~" (I got it, I can feel it now!)

In the midst of climbing, Ziyun’s movements suddenly paused, and its face expressed evident joy.

"You sensed it?" Xu Ran motioned for Star and Cancan to stop, then looked at Ziyun, "What’s the current status of the Extinct Thunder Attraction?"

Ziyun slowly closed its eyes and then opened them after a moment.

"Meow~" (About a month’s time left!) "Give me the specifics," Xu Ran rubbed his forehead and spoke into the phone, "Why do I feel somewhat confused?"

"Uh... I’m not very clear either." Mr. Tony sighed, "Today, the Nightmare Beast King suddenly came to Qingzhou City, and President He and Mr. Gu Wu confronted it. Not long after, the Nightmare Beast King left."@@novelbin@@

"Then... President He came to the shop and told me that the Nightmare Beast King was looking for you."

"Any other details?" Xu Ran couldn’t help but ask further.

"That’s all."

"Alright, I understand." Xu Ran massaged his forehead, hung up the phone, and turned to the three little ones, "It seems we need to make some changes to our plans."

"Meow?" (What happened?)

Ziyun asked curiously.

"Today, the Nightmare Beast King came to Qingzhou City looking for me." Xu Ran paused slightly in his speech, "It probably has something to do with Number Twelve."

"So, we might need to take a trip back and meet the Nightmare Beast King."

"Meow?!" (But I haven’t evolved yet!)

Upon hearing this, Ziyun immediately became anxious.

Currently, it was no match for the Nightmare Beast King.

"We’re not going back to fight," Xu Ran said with a smile of resignation, patting Ziyun’s head, "If nothing goes wrong, the Nightmare Beast King likely knows about Number Twelve’s evolution path."

After some thought, he could only conclude that this was why the Nightmare Beast King was so urgently seeking him out.

However, this also presented an opportunity. Experience more on NovelBin.Côm

Originally, their plan was to wait until Ziyun had completed its evolution and then to take away Number Twelve with absolute strength. If they could peacefully convince the Nightmare Beast King to agree to this pact, it would naturally be better.

"Xi Lu~" (Seems like Number Twelve will be joining the team soon.)

Star, who had come to the same conclusion as Xu Ran, had a hint of a smile in their eyes.

"Cha!" (Then let’s depart now!)

Cancan, who had just been clamoring to continue exploring outside the city, was now eager to return to Beast Field 97.

"No rush." Xu Ran patted the head of impatient Cancan, "The matter with Twelve is certainly important, but we also need to pay attention to the situation here."

"We’re heading out of the city tonight to survey Fallen Thunder Valley on the spot," Xu Ran said with a more serious expression, "We need to at least confirm how long it will be before the Extinct Thunder Attraction emerges so we can return to Qingzhou City and rest easy."

"Ziyun has a faint resonance with the Extinct Thunder Attraction. As long as the two are sufficiently close, I believe we should be able to complete this task," Xu Ran said, pausing briefly, "The only problem is that Thunder Patterned Gold Willow."
