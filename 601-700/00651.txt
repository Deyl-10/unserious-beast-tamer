Chapter 651: Chapter 324: Cancan'S Route! The Examination Of Fireflies! _4

"Meow~" (I need a Four Star Skill Scroll!)

Ziyun didn't hesitate to speak up, while casting a pleading gaze towards Star beside it.

"Meow~" (I still have three skills left, after all are upgraded to stars, I won't compete with you guys anymore.)

"Xi Lu~" (Okay.)

Star neighed in agreement, weighing the options before deciding to consent.

Following that, the two Pet Beasts each took enough Skill Fusion Stones and other items to fuse a skill once. Ziyun used up all the Value Points it had saved to obtain a large number of Skill Points, thus concluding their distribution of resources.

Now that Cancan had acquired its Evolution Path and therefore had the right of priority in resource distribution, it evidently had no intention to use it yet. Only after Ziyun and Star had finished their distribution did it select a large number of Skill Fragments for itself, just in case.

In its first participation in skill distribution, Twelve, after paying off its debts with the Value Points it got, had only half left.

It redeemed the Three Star Skill 'Bewildered Heart Branding' that Xu Ran had previously reserved for it and then exchanged a small number of Skill Fusion Stones to stockpile for the time being.

With the distribution of resources complete, the four little ones started using their newly acquired resources in an orderly fashion. "Then let's start with Cancan's Evolution Path first."

Feeling Cancan's eager emotions, Xu Ran smiled and spoke.

Ziyun and Star nodded silently, indicating agreement.

They had already acquired the Evolution Path of their Emperor Species, so they had no thoughts about this precious resource.

However...

Once Cancan owned an Evolution Path and was ready to evolve, they would have to appropriately yield resources to this junior, Cancan.

Thinking of this, a contemplative look appeared on Ziyun's face.

Its gaze finally settled on the Four Star Skill Scrolls.

With a Four Star Skill Scroll, it could upgrade its remaining three Three Star Skills to Four Stars more quickly, fulfilling all the evolution conditions in advance.

In doing so, it wouldn't have to compete for resources with Star and Cancan later on.

Therefore, this time, it was determined to secure the Four Star Skill Scroll.

As Ziyun was contemplating, Xu Ran had already used the Emperor Species Evolution Path on Cancan.

Lines of text appeared before his eyes.

[Evolution Path: Panlong Turtle (Earth) → Rock Deity Dragon Turtle (Earth)@@novelbin@@

Evolution Difficulty: ★★★☆☆☆

Evolution Potential: ★★★★☆☆]

[Evolution Path: Panlong Turtle (Earth) → Broken Rock Deity Turtle (Earth)

Evolution Difficulty: ★★★★☆☆

Evolution Potential: ★★★★☆☆]

[Evolution Path: ...]

As he scrolled through the options for Cancan's evolution, Xu Ran casually inquired, "Six Star potential?"

"Cha!" (Six Star Potential!)

Cancan nodded vigorously without any hesitation.

As for evolution, of course it wanted to evolve into the strongest!

"Then there's only this one." After reviewing all the Evolution Paths, Xu Ran's gaze settled on one in particular.

[Evolution Path: Panlong Turtle (Earth) → Ancient City Turtle Dragon (Earth)

Evolution Difficulty: ★★★★★☆

Evolution Potential: ★★★★★★]

Seeing the name of this evolution form, a rare look of confusion and wonder crossed Xu Ran's face.

What did the words "Ancient City" in the race name mean?

Forget it, it's probably just a somewhat strange name.

He reassured himself, then clicked to open the complete Evolution Path.

As the lines of text became clear before his sight, Xu Ran's expression grew increasingly puzzled.

This is probably... not just as simple as having a strange name.

[Evolution Path: Panlong Turtle (Earth) → Ancient City Turtle Dragon (Earth)

Evolution Difficulty: ★★★★★☆

Evolution Potential: ★★★★★★

Evolution Conditions:

1. All of Panlong Turtle's talent skills must be enhanced to four-star skills before evolution, and at least three skills should be able to increase its body size.

2. All talent skills reach Violent Sun Level proficiency.

Evolution Materials: Marrow of Thick Soil (main), Eye of the Gargoyle (main), Vein Origin Stone (main), Emperor Stage blood essence of Earth Dragon (main), Brilliant Gem (main), Eternal Life Calamity Dew (main)

Evolution Ritual:

1. Lead a city, migrate for thousands of miles.

2. With the city resting on its back, complete the final evolution under the blessing of countless creatures within the city.

Even Xu Ran, who had seen two incredible Emperor Species evolution paths, found Cancan's evolution path particularly absurd after seeing it.

"Cha?" (How is my evolution path?)

Meanwhile, Cancan had already widened its eyes, looking forward with an expression of expectation.

This caused Xu Ran to fall silent for a moment before he could only tell the truth, "Your evolution path might be a bit difficult to complete."

"Cha!" (No problem!)

Cancan waved its paw nonchalantly.

It was already fully mentally prepared.

"Cha?" (Does it mean I have to hunt down Earth attribute King Stage? I can try that!)

"No, your evolution path doesn't have such a requirement," Xu Ran shook his head, "You don't need to fight with King Stage creatures."

"Cha?" (Then why say the evolution path is difficult?)

Cancan looked puzzled, and even Ziyun and Star drew close out of curiosity.

Equally curious was Twelve, who had never seen an Emperor Species evolution path before.

Facing four pairs of eyes filled with the desire for knowledge, Xu Ran shook his head.

"Cancan's evolution path is quite different from Ziyun's and Star's."

"First, it has one less condition."

"Cancan's evolution conditions don't require not breaking through to King Stage for its growth stage, meaning it can complete its evolution while at King Stage."

"Cha?" (Isn't that good?)

Cancan's eyes widened.

Without a doubt, being able to complete evolution at King Stage meant it had more time to prepare and accumulate power.

If it weren't for the risk that a higher growth stage might solidify life levels, all creatures would prefer to evolve at a higher growth stage.

It would be safer.

"Indeed, that is a good thing," Xu Ran nodded slightly, "But there's something quite off about your evolution ritual."

"According to the requirements of the evolution ritual, you need to lead a city, migrating thousands of miles," Xu Ran paused, looking at Cancan, who was completely dumbfounded, "You heard right, actually lead a city."

Cancan: "..."

Although it could grow increasingly larger with its growth, if it came to leading an entire city, it was still far from sufficient.

"For this, when you enhance your talent skills to four stars, you need at least three skills that can increase your body size," Xu Ran added, "Jiezimixu is one of them, you'll need two more."

"Cha..." (This...)

Cancan opened its mouth, then slowly closed it.

If its growth stage reached King Stage, its body size should further increase. Together with three skills that could enlarge its body size, it might just reach the terrifying size necessary to lead a city.

"Cha~" (If it's just about leading an uninhabited city, that might be doable.)

Although the evolution conditions were outrageous, Cancan was already ready to try in order to become stronger.

"It probably can't be an uninhabited city," Xu Ran shook his head, "Because there's a second part to your evolution ritual."

"Carry the city on your back, completing the evolution amidst the blessings of the city's creatures."

"This means your evolution needs the power of blessings." As Xu Ran spoke, his expression became somewhat odd.

The previous creature that required blessings to evolve was the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood.

But Sky-touching Mysterious Wood evolved into the Holy Spirit Race, while Cancan is just evolving into an Emperor Species.
