Chapter 639 - 321 Fireflies And The Twelve_4

"I understand." Xu Ran nodded slightly.

The same words had been said by the Demon Wood Semi-Saint.

In the end, if he wanted to turn Beast Field No. 97 into a holy land like the Monster Wooden Domain, he still needed his own strength to be powerful enough.

"With that being said, senior, I’ll take my leave now. When my strength is sufficient, I’ll come to find you." Xu Ran gave the Nightmare Beast King a slight bow and turned to leave.

"Go ahead." The Nightmare Beast King opened one wing and gave Twelve a gentle push in Xu Ran’s direction, then flapped its wings and disappeared into the sky.

"Cheep~" (Daddy!)

Twelve’s eyes were filled with reluctance, and only after the Nightmare Beast King was completely out of sight did it flap its wings to catch up with Xu Ran.

It landed lightly on Xu Ran’s shoulder and looked at Ziyun cradled in Xu Ran’s arms.

From now on, it wouldn’t have to compete with Ziyun for a spot. Enjoy more content from NovelBin.Côm

"Meow~"

Ziyun stretched languidly and closed its eyes contentedly.

Xu Ran’s embrace belonged to it alone!

"I didn’t expect things to go so smoothly," Xu Ran said, feeling the starry speed as he glanced at Twelve on his shoulder. "Originally, our plan was to wait until Ziyun evolved into the Emperor Species before we snatched you back."

"Cheep~" (So that’s how it is~)

Twelve suddenly realized.

It seemed it had revealed its evolution path, prompting daddy to go directly to Qingzhou City to find Xu Ran, which had expedited everything.

Otherwise, it would have had to wait until Ziyun evolved into the Emperor Species before…

Wait a second…

"Cheep?!" (Emperor Species?!)

Twelve gazed at Ziyun with its mouth agape.

It hadn’t been separated from its buddy for long, had it?

How come it was already preparing to evolve into the Emperor Species?

"Meow~" (Indeed~ I’ve already exchanged for the evolution path. Not only that, but so has Star.)

Ziyun licked its paw and spoke unhurriedly.

"Xi Lu~" (Yes.)

The starry speedster neighed in affirmation as it raced on, confirming Ziyun’s words.

Emperor Species evolution path!

Unable to contain himself, Twelve swallowed hard, its eyes shining more brightly.

It really wanted it!

Seemingly sensing Twelve’s thoughts, Cancan gave it a wary look.

"Cha!" (The next one is mine!)

It had been looking forward to its share for a long time and wouldn’t let Twelve get there first.

"Cheep~" (Alright then, I’ll wait for the one after next.)

Twelve quickly composed itself, flapping its wings nonchalantly.

If Xu Ran had managed to acquire two sets in such a short period, then getting another two sets shouldn’t take too long.

It had only recently evolved into a King Species; its next evolution certainly wouldn’t come so soon.

And...

It had incurred quite a debt to Ziyun and Star for its evolution and when its first share of resources came, it still had to repay that part.

With this thought, Twelve asked with a bit of guilt.

"Cheep?" (The stuff Ziyun and Star lent me today, is it expensive?)

"It’s alright." Xu Ran stroked his chin, "Two Three Star Skill Scrolls, 37 Skill fusion stones, and 240 Skill Fragments for the fusion, totaling up to 8100 Value Points."

"I’ve opened quite a few branches recently, so the resource income has increased a lot." Xu Ran spoke cheerfully, "By the next resource distribution, you should still have a little left after paying off your debt."

A little left...

Twelve’s expression drooped.

That doesn’t sound good at all!

"Don’t lose heart, you’re already doing much better compared to the three of them," Xu Ran patted Twelve’s head, "after all, the evolution materials were provided by Senior Nightmare."

"Back then, it cost the three of them quite a few value points to obtain their evolution materials."

Hearing this, Ziyun, Star, and Cancan all nodded in agreement.

Especially Ziyun, when it evolved, Xu Ran hadn’t yet visited a Second Level Town, and those rare and hard-to-find main materials for evolution had all been luckily found by it and Xu Ran.

Upon hearing what Xu Ran said, Twelve suddenly felt much better.

"Chirp?" (Are we going to Xieyun City next, or Monster Wooden City?)

It had heard before that after reaching Beast Field number 47, One Man Three Beasts had opened a branch in Xieyun City, and through the recent conversation between Xu Ran and the Nightmare Beast King, it learned that there was also a branch in Monster Wooden City.

In Twelve’s opinion, these were the only two places Xu Ran would likely visit.

"No, neither of those," Xu Ran smiled, "We’re going to Bright Radiance City."

"…Chirp?" (Where is that?)

Twelve looked puzzled.

A new branch?

It had only been away for a bit over twenty days, so how could it feel like it was almost unable to keep up with the updates?

"Chuckle~" (Not just a new branch but also a new companion!)

Cancan let out a chuckle, unable to contain herself from speaking up.

What?

A new companion?

Twelve’s eyes grew even wider.

Was it no longer the smallest one in the team?

Did it now have a junior?

In an instant, its attention was completely captured by the unknown new companion.

"Fireflies are still under assessment," Xu Ran tapped Cancan’s head gently and then looked at Twelve, "When we get to Bright Radiance City, you’ll see."

"Xi Lu Lu~" (We’ll soon arrive at Qingzhou City.)

Star neighed, looking at the outline of Qingzhou City, which was now visible, and suddenly accelerated.

Before long, one human and four beasts passed through the city gates and entered.@@novelbin@@

"Is the problem on our side?" Xu Ran asked, surprise coloring his face as he listened to the Nightmare Beast King.

This was unexpected.

From his point of view, humans were the weaker party in front of the beasts of the Beast Field; just defending the cities had already caused considerable casualties. They ought to be the ones most desiring peace and should not have any reason to object to the proposal.

Therefore, convincing the Nightmare Beast King should have been all that was necessary for things to proceed smoothly.

The implication of the Nightmare Beast King’s words was, perhaps, otherwise?

"It seems you are not aware of the situation within the other 3 Level towns in Beast Field number 97," the Nightmare Beast King guessed the reality from Xu Ran’s confused expression and slowly began to speak.

"Within Beast Field number 97, there are a total of seven 3 Level towns, with the strongest being Changshi City, which has a King Level Beast Master. The most powerful Beast Masters in the other six towns are at the General Level."

The Nightmare Beast King paused for a moment, "Among these seven Beast Masters, four have extreme hostility towards us Transcendent Beings."

"Their goal is to enslave wild Transcendent Beings and turn the entire Beast Field number 97 into human territory."

"This includes Changshi City."

"Under these circumstances, they would find it difficult to agree to a peaceful coexistence with Transcendent Beings, and even if they agreed, they would likely do so insincerely," the Nightmare Beast King glanced at Xu Ran, "unless..."

"Unless there is an absolute power that can override theirs," Xu Ran said, understandingly finishing the sentence.

"Exactly," the Nightmare Beast King nodded slightly, "Although I am now stronger than before, I don’t yet dominate. We still need a much stronger being to stand forth to successfully rally the creatures of Beast Field number 97 for such change."

"The new order is built upon absolute power," the Nightmare Beast King looked at Xu Ran, "Your blueprint is beautiful, but to realize it, you need to become stronger."

"I understand," Xu Ran nodded lightly.

The same words had once been said by the Semi-Saint of Demon Wood.

Ultimately, if he wished to turn Beast Field number 97 into a Holy Land like the Monster Wooden Domain, his own strength had to be sufficiently powerful.

"In that case, Senior, I shall take my leave for now. I will come to seek you out when my strength is adequate," Xu Ran bowed slightly to the Nightmare Beast King and turned to leave.
