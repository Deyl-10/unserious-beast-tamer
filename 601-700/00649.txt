Chapter 649: Chapter 324: Cancan'S Route! The Examination Of Fireflies! _2

```

"Chia…" (This…)

Cancan opened her mouth, then slowly closed it again.

If her growth stage reached the King Stage, her body type would probably expand further, and with three skills that increased body size, she might actually reach the terrifying size capable of pulling a city.

"Chia~" (If it's just pulling an uninhabited city, it's not impossible.)

Though the evolution conditions were outrageous, Cancan had already prepared herself to give it a try in order to become stronger.

"It probably can't be an uninhabited city," Xu Ran shook his head, "because there's a second part to your evolution ritual."

"Carry a city on your back and complete the evolution with the blessings of the living beings within the city."

"This means that your evolution needs the power of blessings," Xu Ran said, his expression growing somewhat peculiar.

The last one needing blessings to evolve was the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood.

But the Sky-touching Mysterious Wood evolved into the Holy Spirit Race, whereas Cancan was just evolving into the Emperor Species.

What was so special about this race named Ancient City Turtle Dragon?

Cancan, upon hearing this, fell silent as well.

Was this truly her evolution path?

"Chia…" (Could it be that we've got the wrong evolution path?)

"Don't worry, it's not a mistake," Xu Ran assured Cancan with a confident look.

The only one among the four little ones who had not obtained an evolution path, Twelve, couldn't help but cast a sympathetic glance at Cancan.

Having roughly understood the evolution paths of Ziyun and Star, it was apparent that Cancan's path was significantly more difficult in comparison.

Just the idea of shouldering a city was beyond its imagination.

Ziyun and Star, who had already obtained their evolution paths, also looked at Cancan with no less pity in their eyes.

This poor child was finally about to be crushed by the weight of life.

After a while, Cancan lay weakly on the bed, her face showing an expression of utter despair.

She gave up on struggling and chose to accept reality.

To evolve successfully, she would not only have to meet the evolution conditions and obtain the evolution materials but also find a city willing to migrate with her.

"Alright, let's continue with the allocation of resources," Xu Ran said, petting Cancan's head as a gesture of consolation before starting to distribute the other resources.

"Meow~" (I need Four Star Skill Scrolls!)

Ziyun spoke up decisively, directing a pleading gaze at Star beside her.

"Meow~" (I have three skills left, after I make them all star-up, I won't compete with you guys anymore.)

"Xi Lu~" (Okay.)

Star neighed, weighing the options, and decided to agree.

Following that, the two Pet Beasts each took away enough Skill fusion stones for one skill fusion and other items; Ziyun used all the Value Points she had saved to exchange for a large number of Skill Points, concluding their distribution.

Cancan, who had also gained the right to priority in allocation after obtaining her evolution path, clearly had no intention of utilizing it and only chose a large number of Skill Fragments for herself after Ziyun and Star had finished their distribution, to prepare for any emergency.

Twelve, participating in skill allocation for the first time, had only half of its value points left after paying off its previous debt.

It exchanged for the Three Star Skill Bewildered Heart Branding which Xu Ran had reserved for it, and then swapped for a small number of fusion stones to hold onto temporarily.

As the distribution of resources was completed, the four little ones began to methodically use the resources they had just acquired.

-----------------

"Then let's start with Cancan's evolution path first."

Sensing Cancan's immense eagerness, Xu Ran spoke with a smile.

Ziyun and Star nodded silently in agreement.

Having already obtained the Emperor Species evolution path, they had no thoughts about this precious resource.

However...

Once Cancan had her evolution path and entered the preparatory stage for evolution, they would have to yield resource allocation to little brother Cancan.

Thinking of this, a contemplative look emerged on Ziyun's face.

Her gaze finally rested on the Four Star Skill Scrolls.

With the Four Star Skill Scrolls, she could elevate her remaining three Three Star Skills to Four Stars more quickly, meeting all the necessary conditions for evolution before anyone else.

This way, she wouldn't have to compete over resources with Star and Cancan later on.

So, she had to get her paws on this round of Four Star Skill Scrolls no matter what.

While Ziyun was contemplating, Xu Ran had already applied the Emperor Species evolution path to Cancan.

Lines of text appeared before his eyes.

[Evolution Path: Panlong Turtle (Earth) → Rock Deity Dragon Turtle (Earth)

Evolution Difficulty: ★★★☆☆☆

Evolution Potential: ★★★★☆☆]

[Evolution Path: Panlong Turtle (Earth) → Broken Rock deity Turtle (Earth)

Evolution Difficulty: ★★★★☆☆

Evolution Potential: ★★★★☆☆]

[Evolution Path:…]

While swiping through the various options for Cancan's evolution, Xu Ran casually asked, "Six Star Potential?"

"Chia!" (Six Star Potential!)

Cancan nodded vigorously without any hesitation.

To evolve, she naturally wanted to become the strongest!

"Then there's only this one." After flipping through all the evolution paths, Xu Ran's gaze settled on one in particular.

[Evolution Path: Panlong Turtle (Earth) → Ancient City Turtle Dragon (Earth)@@novelbin@@

Evolution Difficulty: ★★★★★☆

Evolution Potential: ★★★★★★]

Seeing the name of this evolutionary form, Xu Ran's face showed a rare hint of confusion and blankness.

What did the words "Ancient City" in the race name mean?

Never mind, it was probably just a somewhat strange naming convention.
