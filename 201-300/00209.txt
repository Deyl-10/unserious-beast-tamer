Chapter 209: Chapter 139 Dragon Power, Teachable!_l

With a flicker of consciousness, Xu Ran projected the power from the third vortex that emerged in his mind through the breakthrough of contract power, spreading it towards the obedient Cancan before his eyes.

Given Cancan’s closeness to Xu Ran, there was not the slightest resistance during the contract process.

At the moment the contract was completed, a buzzing sound echoed simultaneously in the minds of both Cancan and Xu Ran.

The contractual sensing was completed for the first time between one person and one pet.

“Charming!” (Daddy!)

Hearing the meaning of Cancan’s words for the first time, the corner of Xu Ran’s mouth twitched.

It’s said that newborn creatures consider the first person they see as their parents.

So…

Is that how Cancan has been calling him all this time?

“I’m your Beast Master, not your dad,” Xu Ran said, laughing and crying at the same time, patiently explaining the difference between the two. “Anyway, even though I obtained your egg and helped you hatch, I’m not your dad.” “Charming-” (Understood!)

Cancan was not disappointed by Xu Ran’s explanation. In its eyes, regardless of the title, Xu Ran was the closest being to it.

At the third stage of contractual sensing, Xu Ran could better understand Cancan’s emotions and thoughts. Feeling Cancan’s current mood, Xu Ran’s eyes softened.

He stretched out a hand, stroking Cancan’s willingly lowered head, while opening his own panel.

[Host: Xu Ran]

Contractual Power: Third Stage@@novelbin@@

Contract Pet Beasts:

Ziyun [View Details]

Star [View Details]

Cancan [View Details]

…]

Just as he was about to open Cancan’s panel to view its details, Xu Ran’s gaze suddenly froze on a certain spot on his personal panel.

(★★Dragon Power](Teachable)

Xu Ran had obtained this skill a long time ago, by achieving B Level Plucking Fur.

Due to the special nature of the Dragon Power skill, he had always been reluctant to dismantle it.

But this skill, neither Ziyun nor Star could be taught, so it could only be temporarily stowed away.

Now that the status of Dragon Power skill has become teachable, it is clear who the corresponding teaching object is.

Xu Ran felt a sense of surprise, yet it made sense.

Although Cancan’s race is known as Golden Scale Turtle,

its appearance seemed to suggest that it had some connection with dragons.

So skills like Dragon Power, which can be mastered by dragon-type pet beasts, could also be acquired by it through instruction.

This could be considered an additional joy.

Without any hesitation, Xu Ran opened Cancan’s panel.

[Contract Pet Beast: Cancan]

Race name: Golden Scale Turtle

Attribute: Earth

Growth Step: Elite Stage (5460/20000) [+]

Race Level: Leader Species

Skills:

[★★Covering the Earth (Starlight Level)] (46/500) [+]

[★★Earth Collapse (Starlight Level)] (12/500) [ + ]

[★★Sturdy RockWall (Starlight Level)] (67/500) [ + ]

[★★Heart of the Earth (Starlight Level)] (21/500) [+]

[★★Reduction (Starlight Level)] (2/500) [ + ]

Xu Ran’s gaze swept over Cancan’s five talent skills, a satisfied expression appearing in his eyes.

Thanks to his familiarity with Cancan, he quickly linked these skills one by one.

The skill that covers the whole body with rocks is Covering the Earth; the skill that shatters a large area of the ground is Earth Collapse; the skill that creates a sturdy rock wall is Sturdy RockWall; the skill that recovers himself and amplifies other skills is Heart of the Earth.

For elite level pet beasts, all skills reaching the Starlight Level is a basic requirement.

Cancan, due to its uniqueness, had directly broken through to the Elite Stage upon hatching, all of its skill proficiencies starting at 0, a situation that was extremely rare.

Luckily, in the past week, under the supervision of the seniors Ziyun and Star and by taking advantage of the unique training environment of the Earth attribute Training Area, Cancan was able to successfully elevate all its skills to the Starlight Level.

Now, Cancan can easily reduce its size to about the same as Ziyun with the Reduction skill, and it’s moved back to the second floor to live with Xu Ran.

Another one moving back to the second floor is Star.

In the past week, Xu Ran had performed Washing and Protection on Cancan twice.

With a fixed target now, B Level Plucking Fur had gained the ability to direct the acquisition of skills, so both times he plucked fur, he gained the Reduction skill, which he then taught to Ziyun and Star.

With Star’s body size, it could reduce its body length to about one meter as soon as it mastered Reduction. At this size, it was totally like a tiny little horse, having more than enough space to move and sleep on the second floor.

As for Ziyun…

Just having made a breakthrough and being at two meters long due to Leadership Stage, Ziyun showed no signs of panic. It walked over to Xu Ran, and by the time it reached him, it had reverted to its adorable size of one meter in length.

With Reduction, they no longer had to worry about Xu Ran being unable to hold them!

“Let’s see the strength of a king species at the leadership stage,” Xu Ran said, stroking its head as he opened Ziyun’s panel.

[Contract Pet Beast: Ziyun]

Race name: Flash Thunder Cat

Attribute: Thunder, Fighting

Growth Step: Leadership Stage (174k/3OOk) [+]

Race Level: King Species

…]

This power…

Xu Ran couldn’t help but smirk.

No wonder they say that each growth stage the pet beast advances, its power increases exponentially. The maximum power of 300k and the already owned took power are not even in the same league as the power at the elite stage.

Today’s Ziyun could easily defeat ten of its past selves.

“Let’s go upstairs,” Xu Ran glanced at his wrist-watch, an expectant look on his face. “If things go as usual, the new resource allocation should start soon.”
