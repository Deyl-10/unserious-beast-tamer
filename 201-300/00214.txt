Chapter 214: Chapter 141: New Discoveries about Skill Fusion_2

Translator: 549690339

According to the previous effect of the Star Chain, when a person and a pet link together, their powers are combined in a “1+1” manner, and as the skill proficiency increases, there will be additional power growth after fusion.

At the Full Moon Level, their combined power could reach around 60,000.

But at the moment, linked by the brand-new Three Star Skill of Fated Star Pulling, Xu Ran can clearly feel, it’s different.

Also at the Full Moon Level, the extra power growth of Fated Star Pulling had reached a terrifying extent, to the point that the combined power of Xu Ran and Star had already exceeded 100,000.

Even Ziyun, who was at the Leadership Stage, had a few serious looks on her face as if she felt a bit threatened by this power.

However, the seriousness quickly disappeared from Ziyun’s face and was replaced by excitement.

Because under the state of fusion with Xu Ran, Star had shown the Night Rune.

The stronger the power, the more potent the amplifying effect.

Feeling the surge of her own agitated power under the blessing of the Night Rune, Ziyun had an illusion that she could slap a Leader Stage to death.

“All right, let’s stop the experiment here,” Xu Ran smiled and jumped off Star’s broad shoulders, looking at the remaining resources of Star, “You still have 12 Skill Fragments and 3 Skill Fusion Stones, want to try upgrading Self-healing Power to Two Stars?”

A thoughtful look appeared in Star’s eyes.

Now, only one Three Star Skill was left to be upgraded.

And the most important Single Horn of the mature Night Demon Dragon in the main material for evolution hadn’t been exchanged in Xieyun City yet.

So, there was still plenty of time.

With Ziyun’s precedent of upgrading her self-healing ability to Superfast Self- healing, Star felt that it was a good choice to spend some resources to enhance her self-healing ability at this time.

“Xi Lu!” (Sure!)

Having made the decision, Star gave her affirmative answer.

“Good.”

Xu Ran nodded, and was about to choose Recovery, the One Star Skill that had been fused with Self-healing Power before, and do the same fusion again.

But just as he was about to click [Yes], his action stopped.

Could there be other possibilities?

Previously, Xu Ran had looked for the most suitable fusion skill for Ziyun’s Self-healing Power among the Thunder Attribute and Common Skills.

Now Star is going to fuse skills, and she needs to choose between Dark Attribute and Common Skills.

Could there be a possibility that there is a more suitable fusion skill in the Dark Attribute than Recovery?

With this thought in mind, Xu Ran silently retracted his hand and began searching in the Dark Attribute exchange list.

His gaze finally rested on a particular skill.

Indeed it was, and… He was very familiar with this skill.

[★Self-healing Power]+[*Night Capture]

[Fusion Success Rate: 31.3%]

[Proceed with fusion?]

[Yes][No]

This success rate of fusion is higher than that of “Self-healing Power+Recovery”, which is 27.9.

What’s more, Xu Ran had a bold idea that he needed to validate.

“Fuse it!” He shouted in a low voice and clicked [Yes] without hesitation.

[★Self-healing Power (WaningMoon Level)](120/2000)[+]

4/ 4* 4′

[★★Night Embrace (Waning Moon Level)](120/2000)[+] @@novelbin@@

His luck was a bit bad this time, even with such a high success rate, it took two stones to succeed in the fusion.

But that’s not an issue.

If his guess works, perhaps he could save a lot of resources for Star.

“Xi Lu?” (What’s going on?)

Star tilted her head in puzzlement.

She could feel that a brand-new skill execution experience emerged in her mind.

But this skill didn’t seem to be Ziyun’s Superfast Self-healing, right?

However…

After feeling the effect of the skill, a surprised look appeared on Star’s face.

Even though it’s different, she likes this one better!

Night Embrace, drawing upon the power of the night to endlessly heal itself.

Although it doesn’t speed up the Self-healing like Superfast Self-healing, this skill focuses on a slow and steady stream.

Superfast Self-healing needs to consume more of its own power, while Night Embrace has no consumption at all.

“Nothing, I just tried a little something,” Xu Ran gave a simple explanation,

“Oh yes, you still have one Skill Fusion Stone.”

Having said that, Xu Ran started validating his guess.

After some selection, the new skill fusion formula appeared before him.

[★★LongNight]+[**Deep Breath]+[**Energy Storage]

[Fusion Success Rate:7.4.%»]

Even though he hadn’t tried a new fusion on “Long Night” yet, Xu Ran had already found the two two-star skills that suit it best.

The two-star common skill, “Deep Breath,” enables the user to efficiently converge power, reducing the consumption of skill use to a certain extent.

The two-star common skill, “Energy Storage,” allows the user to have an extra storage for power, much like a spare battery which can be charged normally and consumed when needed.

These two skills are highly compatible with “Long Night”, that’s why the success rate of their fusion is so high.

But…

Xu Ran directly replaced “Energy Storage” with “Night Embrace” which he had just successfully fused.

[★★Long Night]+[**Deep Breath]+[**Night Embrace]

[Fusion Success Rate:8.19fo]

It worked!

Seeing that the new fusion success rate had exceeded the previous one, Xu Ran’s eyes sparkled with a touch of surprise.

He followed the same method, replacing “Deep Breath” with “Energy Storage”.

[★★Long Night]+[★★Energy Storage]+[**Night Embrace]

[Fusion Success Rate:8.7%o]

Xu Ran:”!!!”

The success rate has increased again!

His eyes were brimming with excitement.

Should he… go for a bigger gamble?

Xu Ran took a deep breath, erased “Energy Storage” once more, and replaced it with…

Nightfall!

[ ★ *Long Night ]+[ ★ ★ Nightfall]+[ ★ ★Night Embrace ]

[Fusion Success Rate:i.i%]

It’s over one percent!

Xu Ran exhaled a turbid breath, and then laughed bitterly.

Fusing skills is indeed interesting.

Although “Self-healing Power” merged with “Recovery” and “Night Capture” respectively resulting in two healing skills, their development directions are completely different.

“Long Night” and “Night Embrace”, which were both resulted from the fusion of “Tenacity”, “Self-healing power”, and “Night Capture”, showed different effects – one recovering power while the other healing injuries.

However, “Long Night” and “Night Embrace” showed a high affinity because they both had fused with “Night Capture”, making their fusion more likely to succeed.

But there is still one problem now.

Looking at the new fusion formula presented before his eyes, Xu Ran stroked his chin.

Would these two skills, since they both fused with “Night Capture”, result in a still two-star skill after the triple fusion, falling short of a three-star skill?

“Star, what do you think?”

Xu Ran shared his discovery with Star, and then asked.

Star seemed to be lost in thought.

Such a fusion clearly had its advantages.

If the skill formed by the fusion of “Nightfall”, “Night Embrace”, and “Long Night” could inherit the characteristics of all three skills…that would be terrifying.

Having all non-talent skills fused and only talent skills left would mean no need to further invest resources in “Self-healing power” and would save resources.

But the disadvantages of such fusion were also obvious.

Firstly, Star had previously invested a lot of skill points in “Self-healing power” and “Nightfall”. After the fusion, the highest proficiency level would be inherited, meaning the previous investment would be wasted.

In addition, as Xu Ran said, such a fusion might not reach three stars since there are repeated skills in the process. In this case, reaching three stars would require additional fusion.

After a moment of struggle, Star’s eyes gradually became firm.

It had made its decision.

“Xi Lu!” (Let’s give it a try!)

Hesitation means defeat.

What it needs is not more skills, but more comprehensive abilities!

“Meow-”

Quietly listening to the exchange between Star and Xu Ran, Ziyun began to look thoughtful.

Like Star, it also has two non-talent skills – “Superfast Self-healing” and “Blood fury”, of which “Blood fury” is still at one star, and its frequency of use has already decreased to a very low level.

If Star’s fusion goes smoothly and the effect is good, should it also try to combine all the non-talent skills to reduce the dispersion of skill points?

If being bolder, could talent skills… possibly be fused?

At this thought, Ziyun looked at Star with anticipation in its eyes.

Little brother, you go first to show us an example!
